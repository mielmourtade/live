Yet Starmer is determined to stoke up the tension.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">It’s important to investigate the reasons behind such a reckless and irresponsible behaviour.&nbsp;</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Since he was elected prime minister last year, Starmer has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/19/starmer-allies-attacking-labour-left-forgot-govern\"> turned his back</a> on Labour’s left/progressive base.</p> <p></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Advised by his chief of staff<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/mcsweeney-did-in-shadows-haunt-starmer-labour\"> Morgan McSweeney</a>, Starmer has <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/uk-reform-labour-surrender-narrative-farage-already-won\">chosen</a> instead to aim for the support of far right and conservative voters, especially those sympathetic to Nigel Farage’s <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-reform-party-conference-bizarre-things-heard\">Reform party</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">There is a logic of sorts to this immoral strategy.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Some Labour voters have <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/uk-local-elections-starmers-betrayal-handing-england-reform\">defected </a>to Farage's Reform party. Starmer wants them back.&nbsp;Hence Starmer’s shocking&nbsp;reversion to the racist politics of<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/video/who-enoch-powell-and-did-he-inspire-far-right-extremist-movement-uk\"> Enoch Powell</a>, turning on minorities with talk of<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/rights-groups-say-starmers-migration-comments-risk-reigniting-far-right-riots\"> an \"island of strangers\"</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">That also explains the grotesque language about Muslims, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/20/labour-deeply-divided-over-starmers-line-on-israel-hamas-war\">\"shaking off the flees\"</a>, a phrase used by a Labour insider&nbsp;describing&nbsp;the slew of councillors quitting the party over the party's policy on Gaza back in December 2023.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">This policy also explains Labour’s cultivation of Britain’s far-right, Islamophobic press, and the otherwise bizarre appointment&nbsp;of David Dinsmore, the former editor of the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sun newspaper, for a senior communications role in government to help win back right-wing voters.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">At the Sun, Dinsmore hosted columnist Katie Hopkins, who holds racist views and once&nbsp;labelled asylum seekers as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-32391620\">\"cockroaches\"</a>.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p dir=\"ltr\">It seems that Starmer wasn’t bothered.&nbsp;</p> <h3 dir=\"ltr\">A moral abyss</h3> <p dir=\"ltr\">This is the moral abyss into which Starmer has chosen to sink. Rolling out the red carpet for violent Israeli thugs fits neatly into this strategy.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">And it has earned the prime minister - who has been excoriated in the media - a very welcome respite after a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/30/uk/keir-starmer-labour-party-conference-intl\">long period of unpopularity</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to his intervention on the Maccabi&nbsp;fans affair, he now&nbsp;has the right-wing press on his side. \"For once, Sir Keir Starmer understood what’s at stake here,\" <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/we-cant-let-this-bigotry-become-the-norm-l3tg8550t\">exults </a>columnist Melanie Philips in today’s&nbsp;Times.</p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">Starmer has been playing the politics of hatred. I do not believe these repugnant tactic will help him win votes</p> </blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">Mike Graham, a presenter on Talk Radio, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cfmmuk/status/1980276323424620652\">voiced</a> his&nbsp;support of the prime minister’s intervention: \"I'm ashamed of the police in Birmingham. These people have no business in our country. And this bloke, Ayoub Khan, whoever he is, should <a href=\"https://x.com/cfmmuk/status/1980276357029315005\">go back to Pakistan</a>.\"</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://members.parliament.uk/member/5357/contact\">Ayoub Khan</a> is the local Birmingham MP who originally <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/mena/2025/10/20/tel-aviv-derby-violence-shows-uk-ban-on-maccabi-fans-is-correct-says-uk-mp/\">petitioned</a> for the ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">As Graham’s repulsive remarks show, over recent days Khan has been subjected to <a href=\"https://5pillarsuk.com/2025/10/18/ayoub-khan-the-muslim-mp-facing-islamophobic-abuse-over-maccabi-tel-aviv-ban/\">a remorseless campaign</a> of smear and vilification. A campaign that scarcely bothers to conceal its racism.&nbsp;</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Mr Khan, it should be stated, is one of the few who emerges unblemished and with his reputation enhanced from the squalid controversy of the last few days.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">It’s Starmer who unleashed all this.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">He has been playing the politics of hatred. I do not believe these repugnant tactic will help him win votes. The British public are too decent, I feel certain, to fall for the prime minister’s inflammatory interventions.&nbsp;</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">According to a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/10/17/ff31d/2\">YouGov poll,&nbsp;</a>a substantial majority of us - 42 percent against 28 percent&nbsp;- think Starmer is wrong.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">And overnight it has emerged that Maccabi Tel Aviv itself rejected Starmer’s hideous tactics. In a body blow to the British prime minister, the club <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/israels-maccabi-tel-aviv-to-decline-tickets-to-europa-league-match-in-uk\">announced</a> that it would not be selling Aston Villa tickets to its own fans.&nbsp;</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Maccabi explained that&nbsp;\"football should be about bringing people together not driving them apart\" and that it had \"been working tirelessly to stamp out racism within the more extreme elements of our fan base\".</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">We can all agree with that. Sir Keir Starmer owes Ayoub Khan a grovelling apology.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</em></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/uk-politics\" hreflang=\"en\">UK Politics</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

They desperately needed drones, anti-tank weapons and modern air defence,” Stoltenberg writes.</p> <p>“Poroshenko was grateful that Turkey had delivered the advanced Bayraktar drones, but dissatisfied that the United States and other Nato countries would not sell weapons to Ukraine.”&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <h3>Stoltenberg and Erdogan</h3> <p>Another major crisis between Nato and Turkey erupted in 2019 when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan invaded northern Syria to create a buffer zone along the border and remove armed Syrian Kurdish groups, which Ankara sees as terrorists, from the region.&nbsp;</p> <p>Stoltenberg describes Erdogan as an “old acquaintance”, whom he had known for years.</p> <p>“Erdogan is committed and knowledgeable and has a good overview of the details of the cases. He is easy to get in touch with. He often brings an iPad into meetings, and with it he shows figures, tables and video clips with which he wants to substantiate his views,” the Norwegian writes.</p> <blockquote> <p>'Do you know the difference between the Taliban and the protocol department? It is possible to negotiate with the Taliban'</p> <p>- <em>Recep Tayyip Erdogan, quoted by Jens Stoltenberg</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Stoltenberg says Erdogan became “a challenge” both for Nato and for him during his time as chief.</p> <p>Turkey ranks low on the democracy index published annually by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and fell even further after the coup attempt in 2016.</p> <p>“During a visit to Ankara, I had been struck by how the new presidential palace exuded power,\" Stoltenberg writes.</p> <p>\"You drove through some high gates and entered a large park, with a mosque and several other buildings in addition to the palace itself. My delegation and I were followed through some enormous halls and up some stairs, through new rooms and into a new hall where we waited for a while.”&nbsp;</p> <p>During another meeting in Istanbul, Stoltenberg expressed “deep concern” about Turkish incursions into northern Syria, and Erdogan didn’t mince his words, saying that Turkey wasn’t against the Kurds because tens of thousands of Syrian Kurdish refugees as well as millions of Kurds lived in the country.</p> <p>“The YPG are terrorists. You’ve said that before. So why don’t you say that anymore? You need them to fight ISIS, yes. But they don’t become less terrorist for that,” Erdogan tells Stoltenberg, referring to the West's relationship to the Kurdish armed group.</p> <p>The Turkish president tells Nato's secretary-general: “You must not think that it is possible to use one terrorist organisation to fight another. You saw what happened in Afghanistan in the fight against the Soviet occupation in the 1980s. You supported the Mujahedin and ended up with the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Don’t make the same mistake again.”</p> <h3>'Lovely roasted chestnuts'</h3> <p>But Erdogan was also full of surprises in meetings. He suddenly asked whether Stoltenberg liked corn, since it was corn season. The Norwegian said he did.</p> <p>“A moment later, they brought in a huge platter of golden corncobs, which we grabbed with our bare hands. There were maybe eight to ten of us in the room, and everyone was munching away. Lovely roasted chestnuts also came,” Stoltenberg writes.</p> <p>“'The protocol department hates this,' Erdogan said, grabbing another flask. 'Do you know the difference between the Taliban and the protocol department?' he asked, looking at me expectantly, as corn kernels and salt sprinkled onto the floor.</p> <p>I shook my head. Erdogan smiled. 'It is possible to negotiate with the Taliban.'”</p> <p>During the conversation, Stoltenberg writes that Erdogan said Turkey had every right under international law to be in Syria, at least as much as the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk\">UK</a> and other Nato countries that had deployed troops to Syria to fight the Islamic State (IS) group.</p> <p>Stoltenberg warned Erdogan not to hit civilians. Erdogan replied: “We kill terrorists. You are the ones hitting civilians when you bomb ISIS in Raqqa and Mosul. No one objects to that.” The Norwegian confesses that \"again, Erdogan had a point\".</p> <h3>Trump, Macron and Erdogan</h3> <p>US President Donald Trump’s decision in 2019 to withdraw American troops in the face of the Turkish invasion in Syria angered Europeans, especially the French.</p> <p>“The reactions in Europe created irritation on the other side of the Atlantic,” Stoltenberg writes. Or as one American aide tells him:&nbsp;\"Europe will defend the Kurds to the last American.\"</p> <blockquote> <p>'It was demanding to have two presidents of major Nato countries [Erdogan and Macron] who had become each other’s ideal enemies'</p> <p>-<em> Jens Stoltenberg</em></p> </blockquote> <p>During the crisis, Erdogan repeatedly told Stoltenberg that Nato had failed and that he would \"flood Europe with migrants\" if Turkey's problems and demands were not understood.</p> <p>The crisis eventually pushed French President Emmanuel Macron to make his famous statement about the alliance. He told The Economist that “Nato was brain dead.”</p> <p>The comment angered Trump, who told Stoltenberg that it was “a disrespectful and insulting statement. You can’t go around talking about Nato like that.” Trump added that the alliance now really only had one problem, and that was France.</p> <p>Naturally, Macron felt differently. After dragging out talks on the Nato 2030 proposal, Macron told Stoltenberg that it was Turkey he was concerned about.</p> <p>“The relationship between Presidents Erdogan and Macron was difficult,\" Stoltenberg writes. \"In Turkey, religion had become an increasingly important political factor. By criticizing Erdogan, Macron could profile himself as a warm defender of the modern, secular state.</p> <p>“Erdogan, in turn, could use confrontations with Macron to present himself as the leader of the Islamic world, someone who stood up to criticism and insults of Islam. It was demanding to have two presidents of major Nato countries who had become each other’s ideal enemies,” the Norwegian writes.</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Macron Erdogan AFP\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"Macron Erdogan AFP\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/Erdogan%20Macron%20afp.jpg\" width=\"1400\" /> </div> <figcaption>Erdogan and Macron pictured in 2018 (AFP)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>But Erdogan's friendship with Trump also helped him to go through some of the roadblocks. In July 2018, Trump put pressure on allies to increase their defence spending.</p> <p>Stoltenberg quotes Trump:&nbsp;\"Slovenia, less than one percent. I’m not surprised. I know my wife, I know what she spends her money on... The great thing about Turkey is that he, Erdogan, can say whatever he wants, there’s no-one controlling him. When he got 61 percent in the election, I said, ‘Why don’t you just say it was 80 percent? That sounds better.’”</p> <p>Trump then claps hands with Erdogan, who was sitting on the other side of him.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Turkey against Sweden and Finland membership</h3> <p>The final challenge Stoltenberg faced with Turkey and Erdogan came in May 2022, when Erdogan decided to block Sweden and Finland’s applications for Nato membership.</p> <p>Erdogan’s move was particularly puzzling because Finnish President Sauli Niinisto had received assurances from Erdogan that Turkey would consider the applications favourably, according to Stoltenberg.</p> <p>“I raised the matter with Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, and he made it clear that Turkey would not oppose Nato enlargement. Several rounds of the Council with the Turkish ambassador present confirmed the same. We thought everything was in place,” the Norwegian says.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Do you want anything? Coffee? Cakes? Sandwiches?' I asked. \"'I’m not that cheap,' Erdogan replied, smiling crookedly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then Erdogan suddenly said Turkey wasn’t prepared to support the applications unless Sweden and Finland took steps to address Turkey’s security concerns regarding the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its Syrian wing.</p> <p>The conversations between Erdogan and Stoltenberg, and between Cavusoglu and his Swedish and Finnish counterparts, went on for weeks.</p> <p>In June 2022, Stoltenberg and others proposed a package where Sweden and Finland would condemn the PKK. But Erdogan did not budge. He insisted that the PKK’s Syrian arm, the YPG, be mentioned in the text, as well as FETO - the Gulen movement Turkey believed was behind the 2016 coup attempt.</p> <p>Stoltenberg writes that he was left alone with Erdogan during a round of meetings to resolve this issue.</p> <p>“I was concerned with one thing: that he should not disappear, not leave the meeting because he had become bored or hungry or tired,” he writes. “'Do you want anything? Coffee? Cakes? Sandwiches?' I asked.</p> <p>\"'I’m not that cheap,' Erdogan replied, smiling crookedly. We were given some sad canapes, but Erdogan devoured them with a good appetite while he and I continued our conversation in private.”</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-blocks-israels-nato-military-drills-until-gaza-truce\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/nato%20drill%20reuters.jpg.webp?itok=Llixb--S\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Turkey blocking Israel-Nato military drills until permanent Gaza truce</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-blocks-israels-nato-military-drills-until-gaza-truce\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Erdogan and Stoltenberg continued their private meeting for an hour while Nato staffers and Turkish officials worked on how to include the YPG in the text.</p> <p>Erdogan reminded Stoltenberg that he had promised to come to Istanbul with his wife. Stoltenberg responded positively, meeting Erdogan on the same wavelength. “I know him, he wants Turkey to be appreciated,” he writes.</p> <p>An adjusted text is proposed, with further mention of the YPG and a stipulation that Finland and Sweden \"will provide their full support to Turkey against threats to its national security\", including not supporting the YPG or the Gulen movement.</p> <p>Stoltenberg thinks they are on target, but Cavusoglu demands the inclusion of a passage discussed earlier in the meeting, stating that Sweden and Finland should take more concrete steps before Turkey ratified the agreement.</p> <p>“I felt impatience coming on. ‘Mevlut, you have to shut up!’ I said and gave him a hard look. There was silence. You can only talk like that to friends, I thought,” Stoltenberg writes.</p> <p>The Norwegian reads the finished text \"slowly, three times\" to Erdogan, Niinisto and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson.</p> <p>“Then I walked around the table. Niinisto said yes. Andersson said yes. Erdogan looked at me first, then at Niinisto and Andersson before looking back at me. ‘Okay,’ he said. The whole room erupted in applause.”</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/nato\" hreflang=\"en\">Nato</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\">Ankara</div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
