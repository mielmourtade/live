Jewish Leadership Council for “promot[ing] public disorder that forced a supermarket to close”.&nbsp;</p> <p>In more recent years, her record has come under scrutiny from supporters of Palestinian rights and justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>She abstained on a key vote in November 2023, brought forward by the Scottish National Party, which called for a ceasefire in Gaza.&nbsp;</p> <p>She stood by the leadership of the Labour Party, as it came under increasing pressure from figures within the party to take a stronger stance against Israeli actions.</p> <p>As a result, independent candidate Akhmed

Friends of Palestine, and that last year she <a href=\"https://votes.parliament.uk/votes/commons/division/1705\">voted against</a> making the boycott, divestment, sanctions movement illegal for public sector bodies.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Guardian reported that Mahmood, as well as Wes Streeting and Hilary Benn, were the leading figures within the cabinet who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/22/starmer-under-pressure-from-cabinet-to-recognise-palestinian-statehood\">called for</a> Britain to move to recognise Palestinian statehood.</p> <p>But anyone who thought she might change the UK’s stance on the proscribed organisation Palestine Action was left disappointed this weekend.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mahmood <a href=\"https://x.com/ShabanaMahmood/status/1964701908322730309\">stated</a> on Sunday: “Supporting Palestine and supporting a proscribed terrorist group are not the same thing.”</p> <p>The UK government <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/handful-mps-condemn-palestine-action-ban-vast-majority-back-proscription\">proscribed Palestine Action</a> under anti-terror laws on 4 July, following an incident in which members broke into RAF Brize Norton earlier this month and spray-painted two planes they said were “used for military operations in Gaza and across the Middle East\".&nbsp;</p> <p>New legislation has made membership of and support for Palestine Action a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison - the first time a direct action group has been proscribed in the UK as a terrorist group.</p> <p>UN experts, human rights groups, and leading figures have condemned the ban as draconian, warning that it will have adverse consequences for the freedom of expression and implications for the rule of law.</p> <blockquote> <p>'[Mahmood] backed officers for arresting those who support the proscribed terrorist organisation Palestine Action'</p> <p>- <em>Home Office statement</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Thousands of protesters have been arrested for demonstrating against the ban, including 890 people who were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rvly00440o\">arrested</a> in London on Saturday.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the weekend, the Home Office posted pictures of Mahmood with Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan Police, in the specialist operations control room during Saturday’s protests.&nbsp;</p> <p>“She backed officers for arresting those who support the proscribed terrorist organisation Palestine Action,” the Home Office <a href=\"https://x.com/ukhomeoffice/status/1964701448098427268\">wrote</a> on X.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her stance on Palestine Action, in line with that of predecessor Yvette Cooper, came under intense scrutiny on social media.&nbsp;</p> <p>With Labour's vote seemingly collapsing in opinion polls, Mahmood faces a delicate balancing act ahead of the next general election, which is due no later than the summer of 2029.</p> <p>Far-right voters are unlikely to become overnight fans of a minister of Muslim origin despite her initially strong rhetoric against unauthorised migration.&nbsp;</p> <p>But voters opposing the ongoing genocide in Gaza may feel she betrayed the cause by adopting the government's line on the atrocities committed by Israel.</p>

It is scheduled to set sail from Sidi Bou Said port on 10 September, following weather and logistical <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/aid-flotilla-bound-for-besieged-gaza-delays-planned-departure-from-tunisia-to-wednesday/3680263\">delays</a>.</p> <p>It would not be an exaggeration to call this the boldest humanitarian civil society mission in recent history, destined to take its place alongside some of the most prominent non-violent civil disobedience actions, such as Gandhi's Salt March.</p> <p>The flotilla brings together people from 44 countries and a wide range of backgrounds. Among them are activists, artists, doctors, politicians and journalists - including climate activist <a href=\"https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2025/09/08/over-1000-welcome-gaza-bound-flotilla-in-tunisia-as-boats-carrying-greta-thunberg-dock/190398\">Greta Thunberg</a> - united by an urgent goal: to deliver essential humanitarian aid to <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestinians</a> in Gaza, who have been deliberately deprived of the means of survival for nearly two years.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165517\">children</a> are <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/famine-gaza\">starving</a>, and those who attempt to access the meagre supply of livestock risk <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/israel-kills-22-gaza-including-13-shot-dead-waiting-collect-food-aid\">being shot</a> while waiting in queues.</p> <p>In the absence of state action, the Global Sumud Flotilla seeks not only to deliver aid and open a humanitarian corridor, but also to assert the unlawfulness of <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\">Israel</a>'s blockade and the legitimacy of breaking it.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <h3>Unlawful blockade</h3> <p>The unlawfulness of the blockade is as clear as the lawfulness of the flotilla's mission. Its basis is the internationally recognised right of the people of Gaza to receive humanitarian aid without interference.<br /> <br /> The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court classifies the \"starvation of civilians as a method of warfare\" as a <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1\">war crime</a>. The Fourth Geneva Convention <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.33_GC-IV-EN.pdf\">prohibits</a> collective punishment, and Additional Protocol I forbids the <a href=\"https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/api-1977/article-54\">starvation</a> of civilians as a method of warfare.</p> <blockquote> <p>International humanitarian law prohibits blockades that harm civilians, starve populations or block relief - all of which apply to Gaza</p> </blockquote> <p>Moreover, under <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf\">Article II</a> of the Genocide Convention, deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to destroy a group, including through starvation, may amount to genocide.</p> <p>International humanitarian law prohibits a naval blockade that disproportionately harms civilians, starves the population, or blocks humanitarian relief - all of which apply to Israel's blockade of Gaza.</p> <p>This is why it has been <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/07/thirst-weapon-un-experts-condemn-israels-deliberate-dehydration-and\">condemned</a> repeatedly by UN bodies and experts.</p> <p>As recognised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its July 2024 <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/case/186\">advisory opinion</a>, Israel is an occupying power in Gaza. It is therefore obliged, to the fullest extent of its means, to provide for the basic needs of Palestinians.<br /> <br /> Under <a href=\"https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1/rule55\">Additional Protocol I</a>, even in armed conflict, the delivery of essential aid cannot be obstructed, nor can it be regarded as interference in the conflict or as an unfriendly act. Parties to a conflict must allow the passage of all relief, even when such assistance is destined for the civilian population of the opposing side.</p> <h3>Right to sail</h3> <p>The binding orders of the ICJ have failed to restrain Israel. In the face of repeated UN Security Council and General Assembly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/un-gaza-assembly-resolution-vote-ceasefire-hostages-4b3585957f01c88ea2ebb13b59d118b4\">resolutions</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/05/07/gaza-israel-flouts-world-court-orders\">demanding</a> an end to its <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\">genocidal</a> actions, no meaningful enforcement has followed.<br /> <br /> States have not only failed to act despite Israel's breach of peremptory norms of international law, but many can even be considered complicit through their continued support.</p> <hr /> <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/gaza-israel-hamas-palestine-war-conflict\" target=\"_blank\">Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></strong></em></p> <hr /> <p>Where the main pillar of the international community - the states - has <a href=\"https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/09/08/the-united-nations-must-act-in-gaza-under-the-uniting-for-peace-resolution/\">failed</a>, transnational civil society has stepped in. The Global Sumud Flotilla is the clearest expression of that intervention.</p> <p>International law of the sea provides no justification for Israel to forcibly interfere with the flotilla's voyage. Customary international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) <a href=\"https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf\">guarantee</a> all ships the right of free navigation on the high seas.</p> <p>Unclos allows interference only in exceptional cases - piracy, the slave trade, unauthorised broadcasting, or if the ship is stateless. The flotilla clearly falls under none of these exceptions.</p> <p>International humanitarian law, as elaborated in the Geneva Conventions, is founded on the protection of civilians. Activists on board the flotilla are therefore entitled to protection as non-combatants.<br /> <br /> Training <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/7/ships-log-a-day-on-board-the-global-sumud-flotilla-heading-for-gaza\">sessions</a> have made clear that all participants are committed to strict non-violence, pledging to remain inactive even in the face of violent interception by the Israeli navy.</p> <p class=\"text-align-center\"></p> <p>This stance comes despite the tragic precedent of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/10195838\">Mavi Marmara</a> in 2010, when nine <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey\">Turkish</a> civilians were killed.<br /> <br /> Israel sought to justify its attack with accusations against the activists, which were swiftly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/un-panel-israel-war-crimes\">discredited</a> by independent investigations. The same pattern has <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/what-gaza-freedom-flotilla\">repeated</a> with other <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/gaza-flotilla-madleen-shows-us-world-it-could-be\">flotillas</a>: Israel's allegations collapse under scrutiny, while evidence of unlawful violence piles up.<br /> <br /> Now, the Israeli government has threatened to treat participants in the current flotilla as \"<a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-bound-flotilla-condemns-israeli-ministers-plan-to-seize-boats-designate-activists-terrorists/3678671\">terrorists</a>\" and to seize their vessels, despite their non-violent mission.</p> <h3>A test of conscience</h3> <p>It is now for Israel to decide whether it will unleash another episode of violence against the united will of global civil society and add yet another layer to its record of <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/12/israels-assault-foundations-international-law-must-have-consequences-un\">international law violations</a>.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-text align-right\"> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Gaza flotilla: The Madleen shows us the world as it could be</div> <div class=\"mee-readmore-author\">Soumaya Ghannoushi</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/gaza-flotilla-madleen-shows-us-world-it-could-be\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>While international law enforcement mechanisms have so far failed to halt Israel's crimes, the law has still created something vital: legitimacy. That legitimacy has awakened global consciousness, rallied solidarity with Palestinians, and led directly to this historic flotilla.</p> <p>By overrelying on crude power and disregarding international law, Israel has entrapped itself in a deepening confrontation with <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/06/03/most-people-across-24-surveyed-countries-have-negative-views-of-israel-and-netanyahu/\">global public opinion</a>.<br /> <br /> Any <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsatsea.org/news/are-humanitarian-activists-global-sumud-flotilla-prepared-israeli-use-force\">violent response</a> to the Global Sumud Flotilla will only tighten that trap, as each act of violence ensures that new waves of fleets will continue to reach Gaza's shores.<br /> <br /> <em>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</em></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/gaza-siege\" hreflang=\"en\">Gaza Siege</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

That law was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/16/austria-approves-headscarf-ban-in-primary-schools\">implemented</a> in 2019 and later <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55277840\">struck down</a> by Austria's constitutional court in December 2020.</p> <p>Now, the government is once again reviving the measure, expanding it with harsher penalties and a wider scope that will include both state and private schools - even <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/09/07/austria-ban-headscarves-young-girls-fine/\">Islamic schools</a>.</p> <p>Supporters of the ban insist it is not an act of discrimination, but is \"<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/16/austria-approves-headscarf-ban-in-primary-schools\">necessary</a> to free girls from subjugation\".&nbsp;Echoing the first ban, the government is again justifying the measure as a way to prevent \"gender segregation\" and \"early sexualisation\", portraying the hijab as a political symbol and marker of \"<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/16/austria-approves-headscarf-ban-in-primary-schools\">political Islam</a>\" rather than a religious choice.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>But such arguments,&nbsp;devoid of empirical support, reflect a deeply ideological and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/islamophobia\">Islamophobic</a> reading of Islam and its practices.<br /> <br /> At its core, Austria's renewed attempt to regulate the religious expression of Muslims is about exclusion. It sends a chilling message that Muslim identity itself is unwelcome in public life, and exposes a broad political consensus that normalises anti-Muslim sentiment and is increasingly willing to sacrifice constitutional rights for political expediency.</p> <h3>A long trajectory</h3> <p>Austria's preoccupation with Muslim dress is part of a longer trajectory.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>They envisioned wider restrictions on the hijab, extending it to high school, universities, and even to adult women in public service</p> </blockquote> <p>In 2017, under previous OVP leadership, Austria introduced a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/austrian-coalition-deal-includes-ban-on-muslim-face-veils-idUSKBN15E1LF/\">full-face veil ban</a>, making it one of the few Western European countries with such a law.</p> <p>The following year, the federal government and state governors quietly agreed to extend the hijab ban to <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/4/4/austria-seeks-hijab-ban-for-primary-school-students\">kindergartens</a> - despite the practical irrelevance of such a move, given that almost no girls of that age wore the hijab.</p> <p>The lack of resistance at that stage helped normalise such measures, creating a precedent for further restrictions.</p> <p>Even the original school-age ban affected very few children directly. But as then-Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache made clear, it was only the beginning.</p> <p>They envisioned wider restrictions on the hijab, extending it to high school, universities, and even to adult women in public service - a measure now proposed by the FPO&nbsp;governor in Styria, who has called for banning religious clothing among <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-far-right-lead-state-government-styria-first-time-2024-12-17/\">state employees</a>.</p> <h3>Political expediency</h3> <p>In 2019, two Muslim families <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/austrian-muslims-to-challenge-school-headscarf-ban-in-court-idUSKCN1SM217/\">filed legal challenges</a> to the school ban, which was overturned by the constitutional court in 2020.&nbsp;The court ruled that the law was&nbsp;unconstitutional, finding it <a href=\"https://www.diritticomparati.it/the-austrian-constitutional-courts-judgment-on-a-headscarf-ban-at-primary-schools-liberalizing-the-illiberal/\">discriminatory</a> for explicitly targeting Muslim girls while exempting Jewish boys wearing a kippah or Sikh boys wearing a turban.<br /> <br /> The stated goal of the law had been to promote \"social integration in accordance with local customs\", uphold \"<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/16/austria-approves-headscarf-ban-in-primary-schools\">fundamental values</a>\" and foster gender equality. Yet the court affirmed that schools should be spaces of \"openness and tolerance\", and concluded the law was inherently unequal in its application.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/austrian-far-right-victory-foreshadows-dystopia-muslim-population\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/2025-01-07T144742Z_1187972502_RC225CAGFT09_RTRMADP_3_AUSTRIA-POLITICS-KICKL%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=9dBWkA-8\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Austrian far-right victory foreshadows dystopia for Muslim population</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/austrian-far-right-victory-foreshadows-dystopia-muslim-population\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Despite Kurz's <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/23/former-austrian-chancellor-sebastian-kurz-found-guilty-of-perjury\">downfall</a> amid corruption scandals, the OVP has continued to champion these policies under successive leaders. After poor results in national elections, the party formed a coalition earlier this year with the Social Democrats and the liberal Neos party.</p> <p>While the Social Democrats have been ambivalent on Islam-related issues, the Liberals have long pushed to extend the hijab ban. As a result, the new coalition agreement includes a renewed hijab ban for girls up to 14, reviving a measure previously floated during the OVP's coalition with the Greens but halted after the constitutional court ruling.</p> <p>Legal scholars question whether the new regulation can withstand another constitutional challenge, especially given that a higher number of girls between 10 and 14 wear the hijab. Constitutional law professor Heinz Mayer <a href=\"https://brusselssignal.eu/2025/09/austrian-government-wants-to-ban-headscarves-in-schools-again/\">noted</a> that the court \"drew very narrow boundaries in its 2020 ruling\", expressing doubt about how these could be overcome.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the policy may serve another function: political distraction. Austria is facing severe economic pressures, with a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/eu-executive-starts-disciplinary-steps-against-austria-over-budget-deficit-2025-06-04/\">budget deficit</a> of 4.7 percent of GDP - well above the EU limit and with little prospect of improvement.</p> <p>In this context, debate over the hijab offers a convenient way to divert attention from deeper fiscal problems.</p> <h3>A chilling message</h3> <p>Political leaders from the OVP and their allies, backed by far-right media outlets, have already begun ringing alarm bells - calling the hijab for young girls a \"<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/09/07/austria-ban-headscarves-young-girls-fine/\">symbol of oppression</a>\" and linking it to \"extremist tendencies\".</p> <p>Politicians are even circulating invented figures about how many girls wear the hijab, stoking paranoia about Islamism allegedly taking hold among children. Integration minister Claudia Plakolm went so far as to declare that \"wherever radical Islam is gaining ground, underage&nbsp;girls wear a headscarf\".</p> <p>This time, the penalties are set much higher, ranging from several hundred euros to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/09/07/austria-ban-headscarves-young-girls-fine/\">1,000 euros </a>($1,080) for repeat offences. Teachers are also required to report their students, turning classrooms into sites of surveillance and punishment, and pressuring both pupils and teachers to conform to the state's policy.<br /> <br /> Yet when the first ban was in force, not a single fine was <a href=\"https://brusselssignal.eu/2025/09/austrian-government-wants-to-ban-headscarves-in-schools-again/\">imposed</a> - underscoring that the policy was symbolic, aimed at rallying support by stigmatising a vulnerable minority, rather than practical.</p> <p class=\"text-align-center\"></p> <p>What is already clear, however, is that the OVP has succeeded in drawing every major party into supporting its anti-Muslim policies. From the OVP to the Social Democrats, the Greens, the Liberals, and, predictably, the FPO, every party has endorsed this discriminatory agenda since 2018.<br /> <br /> Despite Muslims comprising <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/\">nearly nine percent</a> of Austria's population, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/09/07/austria-ban-headscarves-young-girls-fine/\">few</a> hold citizenship or voting rights, leaving them politically marginalised.</p> <p>Even if the constitutional court overturns the ban once again, the damage will already have been done.<br /> <br /> It sends a chilling message to young Muslim girls and boys: that their faith, and by extension their identity, is unwelcome in Austrian society. Muslim families <a href=\"https://www.inach.net/dokustelle-anti-muslim-racism-report-2024/\">reported</a> a heightened sense of insecurity after the first ban, with some teachers emboldened to pressure students into removing their hijabs even before the law was enacted.</p> <p>Austria's fixation on legislating against the hijab is not about safeguarding children but about entrenching exclusion, normalising Islamophobia as mainstream politics, and signalling to a new generation of Muslims that their place in Austrian society will always be <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/austrian-state-attack-muslims-no-sign-easing\">precarious</a>.</p> <p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/islamophobia\" hreflang=\"en\">Islamophobia</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
