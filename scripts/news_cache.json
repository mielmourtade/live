They were regarded as of little account to Britain’s colonial project.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Collusion in genocide</h3> <p>More than a century on, nothing has changed for western elites. On the contrary, their disdain and condescension towards Palestinians have increased. Nothing else can explain the West’s collusion and inaction during two years of Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/meaning-definition-what-genocide-israel-gaza\">genocidal</a> assault on Gaza. Imagine if the victims had been Ukrainians, or other Europeans, in place of Arabs.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is not only western elites who hold these views. Many average people in western countries, despite all that has happened, still regard Israel as an acceptable state.&nbsp;</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/israel-rejects-hamas-truce-offer-thousands-forced-flee-gaza-city\"><b><i>Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine war</i></b></a></p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <hr /> <p>Familiarity with the biblical notion that Jews belong in the Holy Land, and sympathy for their suffering in the Holocaust, have given Israel legitimacy as a “Jewish state”. As a result, many simply “don’t get” how the conflict was spurred by Zionist settler-colonialism and Palestinian dispossession.&nbsp;</p> <p>This does not make them anti-Arab racists, but it provides a permissive background to the prejudices of the elite.</p> <p>Given this context, it is not surprising that two years on from the events of 7 October 2023 - and in the face of a global uprising in support of Palestine - it is possible for the West to devise a peace plan that absolves Israel of its crimes, delivers it a victory it could not otherwise achieve, and solidifies its own colonial hold on Palestine.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>One should be under no illusion about its true purpose: Trump's plan is designed to destroy the Palestinian resistance movement and colonise Gaza</p> </blockquote> <p>Many countries have welcomed the US plan, presumably because of its call for an instant ceasefire, prisoner exchange and entry of humanitarian aid, along with an end to the threat of ethnic cleansing.&nbsp;</p> <p>But one should be under no illusion about its true purpose: Trump’s plan is designed to destroy the Palestinian resistance movement and colonise Gaza.</p> <p>Why else was it drawn up without the input of Palestinians about their own future, while aiming to impose a foreign administration that robs Gaza’s people of agency and independence? Even more insultingly, the proposed “Board of Peace” that would take charge of Gaza is to be headed by Trump, the enabler of Israel’s genocidal crimes, without whom many thousands of Palestinians would still be alive today.&nbsp;</p> <p>Adding insult to injury, the board would include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, widely reviled by Palestinians for his crimes against <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iraq\">Iraq</a> and partiality towards Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h3>Vicious dilemma</h3> <p>The subtext of Trump’s peace plan is that Hamas is the cause of Gaza’s plight, and as such its freedom of action must be terminated. It must either accept the plan’s terms or “<a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-says-hamas-has-three-or-four-days-to-respond-to-gaza-plan-or-pay-in-hell/\">pay in hell</a>”, to borrow Trump’s phrase.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hamas must release all hostages, dead or alive, in its custody <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/full-text-trumps-20-point-plan-end-war-gaza-0\">within the first 72 hours</a> of the agreement’s acceptance by Israel. It would then have to discard its arms and accept having no role in the governance of Gaza.&nbsp;</p> <p>In summary, the US plan aims to rehabilitate Israel, now widely considered a pariah state, while leaving it free to colonise the West Bank (of which there is no mention in the plan). It would give real-estate developers, like Trump’s son-in-law, license to exploit Gaza, and potentially deliver Trump what he so covets: a Nobel Peace Prize.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/palestine-now-conscience-world-no-deal-will-change\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/spain-palestine-protest-madrid-september-2025-oscar-del-pozo-afp.jpg.webp?itok=MDFkEplW\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Palestine is now the conscience of the world.

Hamas faces a vicious dilemma: either accept Trump’s ultimatum - it has so far accepted <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-agrees-release-all-israeli-captives-dead-or-alive\">certain conditions</a>, but major obstacles remain - while running the risk of self-annihilation, or reject it and be held responsible for more death and destruction in Gaza.

Rather, it is western imperialism, and its concomitant denigration of “natives”, that brought us here - and so long as this mentality endures, the persecution of Palestinians, and all non-white peoples, will never end. Even if the genocide in Gaza comes to an end, trouble spots will erupt elsewhere and be handled in the same destructive, supremacist manner.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only when the racism that underlies much of the West’s behaviour is addressed and ended, can the world look to a future based on justice, as opposed to tyranny and brute force.</p> <p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-landing-photo\"> <source height=\"1029\" type=\"image/webp\" width=\"1830\" /> <img alt=\"alt\" height=\"1029\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/max_2600x2600/public/2025-10/%20Pro-Palestine%20during%20a%20vigil%20for%20the%20Palestinians%20who%20have%20died%20in%20the%20two%20years%20of%20Israel%27s%20offensive%20in%20Gaza%2C%20at%20Sydney%20Town%20Hall%20in%20Sydney%2C%20Monday%2C%20October%206%2C%20202reuters.jpg.jpg?itok=5XMAjG-t\" width=\"1830\" /> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

He said a copy of the draft plan was shared at a later stage.</p> <p>\"But it was not a draft that all sides sat around the table to write,\" he said. \"It was a US-led plan towards which we conveyed our views.\"</p> <p>\"What they announced is not exactly in line with the changes we had proposed.\"</p> <p>Ahmad said the joint statement was intended to state the countries' shared objectives and say \"this is what we want to see. And we hope that in the implementation, those things will be ensured\", rather than tacit approval.</p> <p>Ahmad said he welcomed the US's plans for a ceasefire because the UN Security Council was unable to pass any resolutions regarding a ceasefire in Gaza, as the US vetoed them all. The US is one of five permanent council members who possess the right to veto.</p> <p>\"Everyone was saying that it's only the US who can put pressure on Israelis and bring about change on ground.

But he believed the plan was going in the right direction and could continue to be built upon.</p> <p>He also expressed concerns about disgraced former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's involvement.</p> <p>\"Many people think that he [Blair] doesn't have the credibility… I think it would be better if such controversial figures were not there.

While Ahmad said the pact was in the works before Israel violated Qatar's sovereignty, he said \"the signalling is important\".</p> <p>Ahmad said that international perceptions of Pakistan's military strength profile had improved after India initiated a brief, deadly air war against it in May, and its ability to stand up for itself against \"a regional bully\" has proven valuable.</p> <p>\"The most important thing is that we defended ourselves against a bigger country in this environment where you see aggression being committed and countries not being able to defend themselves,\" he said. \"That's the rationale of Pakistan having this capability, because in these times, you cannot rely on anyone. It's basically self-reliance.\"</p> <p>India's unprovoked air strikes on Pakistan in May came after gunmen opened fire in Indian-controlled Kashmir and left more than two dozen people dead.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/how-saudi-pakistan-defence-pact-redrawing-power-lines\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/shehbaz-sharif-mohammed-bin-salman-pakistan-saudi-arabia-military-pact-september-2025-afp.jpeg.webp?itok=-Yq1Q6Rn\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">From Israel to India: How Saudi-Pakistan defence pact is redrawing power lines</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/how-saudi-pakistan-defence-pact-redrawing-power-lines\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>India claimed Pakistan orchestrated the attacks.

Current and former US and Arab officials told MEE that the move could signal the US is preparing for more troops to arrive in the region. Trump's plan has listed Jordan and Egypt as key security partners in Gaza.</p> <p>The deployment of US troops to Gaza is just one of many sensitive points that negotiators meeting in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh this week have to address to end Israel's war on Gaza as it approaches the two-year mark.</p> <p>Arab and Muslim countries were <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/key-middle-eastern-leaders-shocked-israeli-rewrite-gaza-plan-still-back-it\">angered</a> when Trump unveiled his plan last week. Although he recognised two of their key demands - a permanent end to the war and no forced displacement from Gaza - he did not commit to a Palestinian state and left room for Israel to stall its withdrawal from Gaza.</p> <p>Egypt was especially upset that Trump downplayed the role of the Palestinian Authority, MEE <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/egypt-livid-trump-sidelined-pa-gaza-peace-plan-sources-say\">reported</a>.</p> <p>But the US's Arab and Muslim partners are backing the plan. Trump prides himself as a negotiator, and analysts and diplomats say much is still up for discussion this week in Egypt.</p> <h3>'Skin in the game'</h3> <p>Trump called on Sunday for mediators to \"move fast\" to reach an agreement after he welcomed Hamas's response to his proposal as a pathway for a deal. Hamas, Egyptian, Qatari, Turkish, US and Israeli officials are participating in the talks, Arab officials told MEE.</p> <p>The plan calls for the quick release of all remaining Israeli captives in Gaza - roughly 20 are still alive - in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Hamas and Israel have orchestrated prisoner exchanges before, including during a ceasefire in January that collapsed two months later when Israel unilaterally resumed attacking Gaza. If all goes according to plan this time, the first phase of the deal, the captives' release, would be over in 72 hours, although analysts warn it could take longer for Hamas to locate the living and dead captives.</p> <blockquote> <p>'For the Egyptians, a US presence would represent an actual commitment... It would be viewed as skin in the game'</p> <p><em>- Mirette Mabrouk, Middle East Institute</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Israel was still attacking Gaza on Monday.&nbsp;</p> <p>One central sticking point in the talks is the timeline for Israel's withdrawal.</p> <p>Trump's plan provides no specific deadline and leaves Israel space to remain deep inside Gaza.</p> <p>Egypt, Qatar and Turkey are pressing for a complete withdrawal, Arab officials told MEE. Hamas is expected to insist that Israel withdraw to a narrow buffer zone around Gaza before fully leaving the enclave.&nbsp;</p> <p>Arab leaders whose armies are expected to partake in the international peacekeeping force don't want their soldiers rubbing shoulders with Israelis among the ruins of Gaza. Nor do they want to be seen as providing cover for Israel if it unilaterally resumes attacking Gaza. Egypt, which is likely to contribute the bulk of soldiers, is especially worried, Arab officials told MEE.</p> <p>\"For the Egyptians, a US presence would represent an actual commitment to the plan in real terms; troops and funds. It would be viewed as skin in the game, a tangible embodiment of US support, and, potentially, an incentive for Israel to curb violations,\" Mirette Mabrouk, who is currently in Cairo and heads the Middle East Institute's Egypt programme, told MEE.</p> <p>\"Although the attack on Doha proved that US presence is no automatic safeguard against Israeli aggression,\" she added, referring to Israel's attack on the Qatari capital in September.</p> <blockquote> <p>'I don't see this administration particularly interested in having permanent troops involved in peacekeeping'</p> <p><em>- Riccardo Fabiani, International Crisis Group</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Egyptian intelligence has been <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/egypt-hamas-tensions-all-time-high-over-demand-disarm-and-leave-gaza\">in talks</a> with Hamas's armed wing about disarmament, which is stipulated under Trump's plan. It has been a source of growing tension between the Palestinian movement and Cairo. One of the Arab officials familiar with the talks told MEE it was \"difficult\".</p> <p>Several options have been reported, including Hamas turning its arms directly over to Egypt and storing them. The Wall Street Journal reported that Hamas wants to keep its small arms, which it considers defensive.&nbsp;</p> <p>Riccardo Fabiani, the North Africa project director at the International Crisis Group, told MEE that in addition to \"containing Israel\", Egypt wants US troops on the ground to be able to verify the handover of weapons - which Israel could use as a provocation to restart attacks. \"They want the US to participate in whatever disarmament process is going to take place,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I don't see this administration particularly interested in having permanent troops involved in peacekeeping. They prefer bombing a place and getting out,\" he said.</p> <p>Trump's plan rules out Hamas governing Gaza.
