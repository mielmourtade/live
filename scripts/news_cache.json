According to the <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/mamdani-holds-wide-edge-among-jewish-voters-in-new-nyc-mayoral-race-poll/\">poll,</a> he banked 43 percent of the Jewish vote overall.</p> <p>Some of these Mamdani voters have formed a subgroup within his support base, calling themselves \"<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jewsforzohran/?hl=en\">Jews for Zohran</a>\" - made up of individuals and members of organisations like Jews for Racial and Economic Justice and Jewish Voice for Peace, which have mobilised to engage their communities, as well as New Yorkers in general.&nbsp;</p> <p>As NYC’s mayoral elections draw to a close, Middle East Eye spoke to some Jewish voters who chose to support and canvas for the candidate, despite him being regularly smeared as an antisemite.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Jacob Bloomfield has joined thousands of canvassers to get the word out about the campaign. He is supporting Mamdani because he believes that “everyone in our society should have access to a basic standard of living: housing, healthcare, education, transportation, nutritious food, and safety”.&nbsp;</p> <p>He is concerned that “those basic building blocks of a stable life are out of reach for many, with more struggling to hold onto them, including New Yorkers who have what would have been considered solid, middle-class jobs thirty years ago”.&nbsp;</p> <p>“That’s unacceptable, and Mamdani is the only candidate who is seriously reckoning with the tragedy and gravity of that situation.”</p> <p>Bloomfield said he wanted to canvas because, “just talking to people about ideas, face to face, is the most fundamental and, arguably, important aspect of politics”. He believes that young Jews were out supporting Mamdani both because they do not believe Israel represents them, and because - like any other demographic - they have the same concerns about affordability.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Israel claims to represent Jews everywhere in order to cultivate consent for its heinous actions, even as Israeli officials take potshots at American Jews, and non-Orthodox Jews from abroad are not allowed to practice their religion freely in Israel,” he said.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>“Anti-Zionist Jews feel the need to speak out against murder, conquest, environmental destruction, starvation, displacement, and all manner of atrocities ostensibly being done in their names,” he added.</p> <h3>'I love his principles'</h3> <p>Actor and comedian Matt Ketai, 36, has also been out canvassing for Mamdani. He loves both the platform Mamdani was running on and his energy.</p> <p>“I believe who Zohran is. I love his principles. I love his ideas. I love that he's energising. He really just wants to be mayor of New York City. It's so rare to have someone who just wants to make the city they love a better place. I don't see that in any other politician.\"</p> <p>He expressed concern about Independent mayoral candidate and former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and others pushing <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/trending/cuomos-last-ditch-attacks-mamdani-condemned-racist-islamophobic\">Islamophobic</a> narratives about Zohran and calling him antisemitic.</p> <p>“All the Islamophobia that I've seen and this talk of antisemitism actually makes me feel less safe as a Jew because they're pushing these concepts and ideas that aren't actually true,\" Ketai said.</p> <blockquote> <p>'It's actually the rhetoric of Andrew Cuomo that is making people less safe'</p> <p><em>- Matt Ketai, comedian&nbsp;</em></p> </blockquote> <p>“It's actually the rhetoric of Andrew Cuomo that is making people less safe,” he said.”It's emphasising the idea of antisemitism.

I think what's funny is that statement alone would be to the chagrin of anti-Zionists and Zionists, because anti-Zionists see him as one of their own, and Zionists see him as an enemy,\" Bloomfield said.</p> <p>“I think the idea that he's not anti-Israel, ironically, might be a comment that would unite both sides in that it would upset both of them, because anti-Zionists and Zionists are united in thinking he's anti-Israel.\"</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/zohran-mamdanis-support-palestinian-rights-sealed-his-mayoral-candidacy-win-polling-shows\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/2025-07-02T161717Z_863450748_RC2GEFA5XN2W_RTRMADP_3_USA-NEWYORK-MAYOR-ELECTION.JPG.webp?itok=15QYpR_M\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Zohran Mamdani's support for Palestinian rights sealed mayoral primary win, poll shows</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/zohran-mamdanis-support-palestinian-rights-sealed-his-mayoral-candidacy-win-polling-shows\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>He said that Cuomo \"acts like he is Jewish\", although he is not.&nbsp;</p> <p>“When it comes to the Israel issue, I consider Cuomo to almost be like a faux Jew. He almost acts like he is Jewish, and the king of Jews. He uses random Yiddish words during a debate. I kept saying to the screen, ‘You are not Jewish',\"&nbsp;Espiritu-Bloomfield said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Espiritu-Bloomfield said he “takes comfort” in the fact that Mamdani is Muslim because Judaism and Islam come from the same place. “They're both Semitic, so the language sounds similar, the food is similar, [and] many Jewish principles are very similar to the five pillars of Islam. At the end of the day, all I can say is I believe that all Jews, no matter what they identify as ideologically, are part of his vision for the future of New York.”</p> <h3>Minority solidarity</h3> <p>A 66-year-old Jewish man from Manhattan's Upper East Side, who did not want to be named, said there is an “awful divide\" in the Jewish community. He says the first divide is over Israel, and the second over Mamdani, which he says may be a \"proxy for Israel\", in that it exposes where you stand on Israel.</p> <p>While he had voted for Brad Lander in the primary, he was now supporting Mamdani in the upcoming mayoral election, something that had earned him pushback.</p> <p>“I’ve got the most vile comments over my support for Mamdani from people. I go to a prosperous East Side synagogue. I’ve heard people say they don’t feel safe and they will have to move. These are people living in million-dollar houses who have second homes. I don’t know what they think will happen to them,\" he said.</p> <p>“Many Jews are disgusted by the naked and vile Islamophobia in both the non-Jewish and even more surprisingly, in the Jewish community.\"</p> <p>He said that Mamdani has shown a \"concerted effort\" to engage Jewish communities and that he understands what it's like for both Jews and Muslims to live as minorities in a Christian majority community.</p> <p>“I think there are Jews voting for Mamdani who are keeping their mouth shut because you get a lot of shit.”</p> <p>But he seems hopeful about how Mamdani will perform on 4 November among Jews in New York City.</p> <p>“When the dust settles, I think thousands of Jews will have voted for Mamdani.”</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/us-politics\" hreflang=\"en\">US Politics</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

They need electricity to run and, importantly, to be cooled down. In the US, tech companies are turning to gas turbines to power data centres.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia generates about 60 percent of its electricity from natural gas. Because oil is so plentiful in the Gulf state and easy to extract, Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the world that still generates electricity by burning crude and fuel oil, which contributes to a little more than one-third of its electricity generation. Solar contributes about two percent to Saudi Arabia’s electricity, but that number is growing fast.</p> <blockquote> <p>'You are going to have the lowest-cost energy to build data centres anywhere in the world'</p> <p><em>- Amin Nasser, CEO of&nbsp; Aramco</em></p> </blockquote> <p>As would be expected in the world’s largest oil exporter, gas prices in Saudi Arabia are very cheap. The price of electricity is also a bargain compared to Europe and even the relatively energy-rich US.</p> <p>Commercial electricity prices in Saudi Arabia are anywhere from 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the global average, according to a report by consulting firm Roland Berger.</p> <p>\"This significant saving can directly improve data center operators' profitability,” the authors <a href=\"https://www.rolandberger.com/en/Insights/Publications/Unlocking-the-Data-Center-opportunity-in-KSA.html\">said</a>.</p> <p>The link between Saudi energy and AI was on full display on Tuesday, when state-backed oil giant Saudi Aramco announced plans to acquire a \"significant minority stake\" in Humain.</p> <p>“Data centres need lower-cost energy,” Amin Nasser, the CEO of&nbsp; Aramco, said last year, in a pitch to the AI industry. “You are going to have the lowest-cost energy to build data centres anywhere in the world because this is the place for it.”</p> <figure class=\"align-center media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Humain\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"Humain\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/Humain-AI-Saudi-Arabia-AFP.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /> </div> <figcaption>Guests stand at the booth of Saudi artificial intelligence company Humain during the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh, on 29 October 2025 (Fayez Nureldine/AFP)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p>Experts say that Saudi Arabia would like to use renewable energy to power data centres.

That will be used for domestic consumption and not export,” Priddy said.</p> <p>In the meantime, Saudi Arabia benefits from having crude oil to burn, literally.&nbsp;</p> <p>“If Saudi Arabia burns crude oil to do this, they essentially pay nothing,” Ellen Wald, an expert on energy and author of <i>Saudi Inc</i>., told MEE.</p> <h3>Oil to burn</h3> <p>While some oil exporters want to limit domestic use to free up barrels for export, experts say that Saudi Arabia’s deposits are so vast and cheap to tap that the kingdom doesn’t need to worry. Saudi Arabia has the <a href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-09/2021-09_Petroleum_Watch_ADA.pdf\">lowest</a> oil production cost in the world, at less than $10 per barrel.</p> <p>“If Saudi Arabia can make more by burning crude to power data centres than exporting it, it's worth it,” Wald said.</p> <p>Oil prices reached over $100 per barrel after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but have been trending down over the last three years. The International Energy Agency <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/as-oil-market-surplus-keeps-rising-something-s-got-to-give\">said</a> in October that the world produced an oil surplus of 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd) from January to September and estimates that number may rise to 4 million bpd next year.</p> <blockquote> <p>'In Saudi Arabia, the price of electricity is whatever the government wants it to be, unlike in the West'</p> <p><em>- Pierre Pinson, Imperial College London</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In sum, one of the biggest constraints that China and the US face in achieving AI dominance - the price of energy - Riyadh can brush off.</p> <p>“If the Saudis wanted to increase their capacity by half a million barrels per day just to power data centres, they could do that without a problem and not give up anything on exports,” Priddy said.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has pushed through social and economic reforms while curbing the power of the country’s religious establishment and secular political opponents.</p> <p>Amid a global cost-of-living crisis, the crown prince has shown he is sharply sensitive to the cost consciousness of the people of Saudi Arabia. Earlier this year, he issued a sweeping decree freezing the rent price in Riyadh for a period of five years.</p> <p>He can do the same with electricity prices.</p> <p>“In Saudi Arabia, the price of electricity is whatever the government wants it to be, unlike in the West,” Pinson said.</p> <p>“Whereas in the US you have a free market that accounts for network constraints, that’s why you have high residential electricity prices in regions near data centres. That huge demand is reflected in prices.”</p> <figure class=\"align-center media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"ai saudi\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"ai saudi\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/riyadh-ai-summit-afp.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /> </div> <figcaption>Guests attend the Global AI 2020 Summit in the Saudi capital Riyadh, on 21 October 2020 (Fayez Nureldine/AFP)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p>The idea of Saudi Arabia leveraging its fossil fuel wealth into other industries is not new. The whole point of the crown prince’s Vision 2030 initiative is to diversify the economy away from a reliance on oil exports.</p> <p>PIF, the kingdom’s repository for its oil wealth, is investing in mega projects, such as Neom, on the Red Sea coast. But some of the more grandiose parts of Vision 2030, such as the futuristic 170km-long city called The Line, are being scaled back.</p> <p>Now, PIF plans to focus on tried-and-true industries, such as logistics, mineral exploitation, and religious tourism, as it contends with lower energy prices and rising budget deficits, Reuters reported this week. AI is one industry where the kingdom is doubling down, partially because it has cheap energy, experts say.</p> <p>“This is not the first time Saudi Arabia has done this. They tell companies, 'come build your auto-plant in our country and you won’t have to pay for energy',” Wald said.</p> <p>However, that has only brought mixed success to the kingdom.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Who else is going to buy it?</h3> <p>For example, Saudi Arabia has struggled to develop a heavy manufacturing sector, in part because foreign investors have been reluctant to build expensive, complex factories in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia also lacks the skilled labour to staff such facilities.&nbsp;</p> <p>The kingdom has been more successful in parlaying its oil wealth into petrochemicals. These are the refined polymers and compounds of oil that are found in everything from fertilisers and plastics to laundry detergents, paper, and clothing.</p> <p>The last piece of the puzzle for Saudi Arabia is getting the advanced semiconductors that power data centres. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-officials-do-not-want-sell-advanced-ai-chips-company-run-uae-spy-chief-report\">lobbying</a> the Trump administration hard on this front.</p> <p>When Trump visited the kingdom in May, he gave approval for Nvidia to sell 18,000 of its newest \"Blackwell\" chips to Humain. The UAE was also promised hundreds of thousands of chips.</p> <p>Those deals are in limbo as some US officials <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/ai-weapons-trumps-gulf-visit-looks-swap-politics-business\">raise concerns</a> about the kingdom’s ties to China. They worry that the advanced US technology could be shared with Beijing.&nbsp;</p> <p>It has almost become routine for Saudi business leaders and officials to reassure the US that they will not share American technology with China, which is the top buyer of Saudi oil.</p> <p>“In our case, I will never do that,” Tareq Amin, Humain’s CEO, said during FII in Riyadh this week, when asked if he would purchase Huawei technology.</p> <p>One Saudi analyst who speaks with officials in the country told MEE that they are confident the Trump administration will eventually approve the sales.&nbsp;</p> <p>“The Europeans don’t have the money, and China is out. Who else is going to buy this expensive American technology?”</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/inside-saudi\" hreflang=\"en\">Inside Saudi Arabia</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
