Smith noted that Yaghi, 60, is probably the first Nobel laureate to be born in Jordan.</p> <p>Yaghi was born and raised in a Palestinian refugee camp in Amman,&nbsp;Jordan's capital, before&nbsp;moving to the US when he was 15.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>\"I grew up in a very humble home,\" Yaghi recalled. \"There were dozens of us in one small room, sharing it with the cattle that we used to raise.

Rumours are circulating that King Mohammed VI <a href=\"https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2025/10/262529/benkirane-urges-gen-z-protesters-to-show-wisdom-before-kings-speech/\">will address</a> the youth-led movement, which has <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/inside-morocco\">shaken</a> the country with mass protests, in a speech on Friday.</p> <p>Hundreds of participants type passionately in the server’s general chat, arguing over whether to pause demonstrations for the week in anticipation of the monarch’s remarks. Others break off into smaller audio rooms, their voices overlapping in heated but orderly debate.</p> <p>For the past two weeks, this has been the nightly rhythm as young Moroccans have turned Discord, the once niche gaming platform, into a powerful tool for nationwide protests <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/moroccan-genz-protesters-want-defend-their-right-dignified-life\">demanding</a> better public services and an end to corruption in the North African kingdom.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/what-genz-212-group-behind-protests-morocco\">GenZ 212</a>, named after Morocco’s international telephone code and recent wave of youth-led social justice movements worldwide, has grown from fewer than 1,000 members at its launch on 18 September to more than 180,000 today.</p> <p>Analysts say Discord has been essential to sustaining the movement’s decentralised structure. GenZ 212 has deliberately positioned itself as apolitical and unaffiliated, rejecting the hierarchical leadership models that defined earlier movements.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>While the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/inside-movement-what-left-moroccos-february-20\">February 20 Movement</a> of 2011 relied on Facebook and alliances with political parties and unions, GenZ 212 has turned instead to closed digital spaces, embracing fluid, horizontal forms of organising that reflect a new generation’s political instincts.</p> <p>Imad Zoukanni, 28, first came across news of the protest on Instagram, then learned that a growing community on Discord was coordinating plans for peaceful demonstrations. His decision to get involved was driven by the loss of his cousin, who had died of breast cancer after enduring months of delays in Morocco’s public health system.</p> <p>What struck him most was the movement’s structure.</p> <p>“This wasn’t a party or a movement with a leader. It was a collective uprising of ordinary people. I joined because it gave me hope that we don’t have to accept being ignored any more,” he tells Middle East Eye.</p> <p>He describes Discord as the movement’s “backbone”, a place where young activists share lived experiences of unemployment, corruption, failing schools and hospitals, and patients abandoned by the system.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>“These are the stories the government tries to erase,” he says.</p> <h3>Accessibility and flexibility</h3> <p>The movement also uses the server to plan peaceful protest strategies, discuss demands, share ways to protect themselves from police violence, which <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/morocco-two-people-killed-police-during-genz-212-protests\">caused</a> the death of three people last week, and counter misinformation spread by state-owned media.</p> <p>Zoukanni says one of the central demands in these discussions is the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/moroccos-protest-movement-calls-king-dissolve-government\">resignation</a> of Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch, whose government has presided over a steady decline in public healthcare, driven by privatisation, inadequate services and overcrowded, unsanitary facilities.</p> <p>Earlier this month, tens of thousands of young Nepalis used Discord to organise anti-government demonstrations that <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/trending/nepal-revolutionary-gen-z-protests-spark-global-solidarity\">forced</a> the prime minister,&nbsp;Sharma Oli, to resign.</p> <p>Dr Sahar Khamis, a professor at the University of Maryland and an expert on Arab and Muslim media, told MEE that Discord’s accessibility and flexibility fill a gap left by older platforms, and these characteristics make it especially appealing to young people.</p> <blockquote> <p>‘This wasn’t a party or a movement with a leader. It was a collective uprising of ordinary people. I joined because it gave me hope that we don’t have to accept being ignored any more’</p> <p><em>- Imad Zoukanni</em><em>, Moroccan GenZ activist</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Unlike mainstream social media, Discord is not ruled by algorithms, giving users full control over how information flows. Its thematic channels resemble a blend of Telegram, Slack and Teams, buzzing with simultaneous discussions on strategy, logistics and messaging.</p> <p>The platform works across devices, integrates audio, video and text, and makes it easy for large communities to coordinate in real time.</p> <p>GenZ 212 uses regional Discord channels to tailor strategies to the specific challenges of each city. In Marrakesh, for example, protests were met with immediate repression because of the city’s tourist visibility. Organisers responded by shifting meeting locations away from tourist areas to avoid police crackdowns.</p> <p>Channels for young Moroccans in the diaspora have also become spaces for global coordination, allowing nationals abroad to join discussions and plan demonstrations in cities including Paris and Montreal.</p> <p>“The diaspora are our international allies,” Zoukanni says.</p> <p>“They know what it feels like to leave home because of the government. In a way, they’re carrying our fight into spaces where the Moroccan state tries to project a false image while hiding the reality of poverty and repression.”</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Protesters have criticised the government for <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/morocco-s-world-cup-financing-gets-going-with-rare-eurobond-sale\">pouring billions</a> into football infrastructure ahead of this winter's Africa Cup of Nations and the 2030 World Cup, accusing authorities of chasing international prestige abroad while <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/moroccan-genz-protesters-want-defend-their-right-dignified-life\">neglecting</a> basic healthcare, education and services in a country marked by widespread poverty and high youth unemployment.</p> <h3>‘Digital tug of war’</h3> <p>Meanwhile, privacy settings and pseudonyms offer a layer of protection that open platforms like Facebook no longer provide in an era of heightened surveillance.</p> <p>This shift is part of a broader trend.</p> <p>“When the Arab Spring happened in 2011, governments were taken by surprise,” says Dr Khamis. “Now regimes are much more prepared and technologically savvy themselves.”</p> <p>The first GenZ 212 <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/morocco-rocked-protests-over-education-health-reforms\">demonstrations</a> on 27 September caught authorities off guard with their peaceful yet disruptive spontaneity.

One Moroccan PhD student living in Frankfurt runs an Instagram page to raise awareness of the movement’s demands and dispel misinformation by Moroccan media, which largely relays the authorities’ narrative.</p> <p>“I felt triggered while looking at social media and media outlets, which are my first sources for understanding the situation in Morocco,” Omar, who uses a pseudonym for safety reasons, tells MEE.</p> <p>“Hesspress, one of the most well-known media outlets, focused mainly on violence from the protesters and did not mention or spotlight any violence by state police. That was the moment I realised how important social media has become for producing alternative narratives.”</p> <p>Omar joined Discord to follow discussions, track announcements and understand the movement’s demands.</p> <p>What stood out to him was Gen Z 212’s emphasis on voting and collective and democratic decision-making, despite the number of users increasing.</p> <p>The movement’s rapid, horizontal expansion has created organisational challenges.</p> <blockquote> <p>‘I see it as a form of protest. They’ve realised they can create change by raising their voices online’</p> <p><em>- Dr Claudia Flores-Saviaga, researcher at Northeastern University’s Citizen AI Lab</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Growing participation fuels misinformation, complicating coordination, while some participants have shared information that could expose the server to legal risks. Proposals to verify identities, such as confirming who is Moroccan, were quickly dismissed as impractical.</p> <p>Dr Claudia Flores-Saviaga, a digital activism researcher at Northeastern University’s Citizen AI Lab, explains to MEE that participation in online movements typically follows a pattern of self-regulation.</p> <p>A small core of highly active members coordinates discussions and manages channels, while most users observe or contribute minimally. Over time, communities develop their own informal rules and culture, maintaining order without strict enforcement.</p> <p>A constant flow of new participants keeps the space dynamic as some become active while others fade away.</p> <p>With its Discord membership reaching 180,000, GenZ 212 administrators have introduced rules to manage discussions. During large podcast sessions with more than 6,000 participants, users face a three-minute message limit to control chat flow. Microphone access is tightly moderated, and the “raise hand” function was disabled due to overuse.</p> <p>Meanwhile, smaller audio rooms capped at 15 participants are now used for deeper, more focused conversations. These discussions flow organically between a few speakers and operate without time restrictions or formal limits.</p> <h3>A collective voice</h3> <p>Despite its strengths, Discord has some limitations.</p> <p>The application’s volunteer-based moderation model has drawn <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/10/04/du-maroc-au-nepal-comment-discord-malgre-ses-limites-est-devenu-un-outil-de-mobilisation-de-la-jeunesse_6644380_4408996.html\">criticism</a> for allowing harassment and violent content to persist.

Past experiences, such as the 2011 protests and the case of Nasser Zefzafi, the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/morocco-upholds-sentences-against-hirak-protesters\">Rif Hirak</a> leader sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2019, have instilled caution towards appointing representatives.</p> <p>Others have also rejected government calls to appoint a single negotiator, arguing that the movement’s demands are already public and that such talks would serve political parties more than protesters.</p> <blockquote> <p>‘At the end of the day, it’s always people on the street who can really make change happen and make a difference, not the tools’</p> <p><em>- Dr Sahar Khamis, professor at University of Maryland</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Some have noted that appointing a representative would contradict its decentralised structure, create a figurehead that leaves the movement vulnerable to co-optation, and undermine its collective spirit.</p> <p>Activists have also stressed that GenZ 212 is not a political entity but a collective voice, and that issues such as healthcare, education and accountability are state responsibilities, not matters for negotiation.</p> <p>The movement is part of a broader global wave of youth-led mobilisations that inspire and influence one another.</p> <p>Gen Z activists have recently been at the forefront of anti-corruption and social justice protests in countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Peru and Madagascar.</p> <p>Dr Khamis explains that witnessing other youth movements creates a ripple effect, motivating young people to act.</p> <p>She cautions, however, against overstating the role of technology through terms such as “Facebook revolution” or “Discord uprising”, calling this a “technologically deterministic” view.</p> <p>“At the end of the day, it’s always people on the street who can really make change happen and make a difference, not the tools,” she says.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/inside-morocco\" hreflang=\"en\">Inside Morocco</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

But who could have imagined back in October 2023 that we would now be marking the two-year anniversary of a <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/meaning-definition-what-genocide-israel-gaza\">genocide</a>, documented in the minutest detail on our phones every day for 24 months? A genocide that could have been stopped at any point, had the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a> and its allies made the call.</p> <p>This is an anniversary so shameful that no one in power wants it remembered. Rather, they are actively encouraging us to forget the genocide is happening, even at its very height. <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\">Israel</a>’s relentless crimes against the people of Gaza barely register in our news any longer.</p> <p>There is a horrifying lesson here, one that applies equally to Israel and its western patrons. A genocide takes place - and is permitted to take place - only when a profound sickness has entered the collective soul of the perpetrators.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the past 80 years, western societies have grappled with - or, at least, thought they did - the roots of that sickness.&nbsp;</p> <p>They wondered how a Holocaust could have taken place in their midst, in a <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/germany\">Germany</a> that was central to the modern, supposedly “civilised”, western world.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>They imagined - or pretended to - that their wickedness had been extirpated, their guilt cleansed, through the sponsorship of a “Jewish state”. That state, violently established in 1948 in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, served as a European protectorate on the ruins of the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestinian</a> people’s homeland.</p> <p>The Middle East, let us note, just happened to be a region that the West was desperate to keep controlling, despite growing Arab demands to end more than a century of brutal western colonialism. Why? Because the region had recently emerged as the world’s oil spigot.</p> <h3>Tragedy, then farce</h3> <p>Israel’s very purpose - enshrined in the ideology of Zionism, or Jewish supremacism in the Middle East - was to act as a proxy for western colonialism. It was a client state planted there to keep order on the West’s behalf, while the West pretended to withdraw from the region.</p> <p>This big picture - the one western politicians and media refuse to acknowledge - has been the context for events there ever since, including Israel’s current, genocidal endgame in Gaza.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/israel-rejects-hamas-truce-offer-thousands-forced-flee-gaza-city\"><b><i>Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine war</i></b></a></p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <hr /> <p>Two years in, what should have been obvious from the start is becoming ever-harder to ignore: the genocide had nothing to do with Hamas’s one-day attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. The genocide was never about “self-defence”. It was preordained by the ideological imperatives of Zionism.</p> <p>Hamas’s break-out from Gaza - a prison camp into which Palestinians had been herded decades earlier, after their expulsion from their homeland - provided the pretext. It all too readily unleashed demons long lurking in the soul of the Israeli body politic.</p> <p>And more importantly, it released similar demons - though better concealed - in the western ruling class, as well as parts of their societies heavily conditioned to believe that the interests of the ruling class coincide with their own.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>Gaza, not just Hamas, faces an ultimatum: 'Take the deal, or we will put you in concrete boots and sink you in the Mediterranean'</p> </blockquote> <p>Two years into the genocide, the West is still deep in its self-generated bubble of denial about what is going on in Gaza - and its role in it.&nbsp;</p> <p>“History repeats itself,” as the saying goes, “first as tragedy, then as farce.”</p> <p>The same could be said of “peace processes”.&nbsp;Thirty years ago, the West force-fed Palestinians the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/recognition-palestine-repeat-wests-oslo-peace-fraud\">Oslo Accords</a> with the promise of eventual statehood.&nbsp;</p> <p>Oslo was the tragedy. It led to an ideological rupture in the Palestinian national movement; to a deepening geographic split between an imprisoned population in the occupied West Bank and an even more harshly imprisoned population in Gaza; to Israel’s increasing use of new technologies to confine, surveil and oppress both sets of Palestinians; and finally, to Hamas’s brief break-out from the Gaza prison camp, and Israel’s genocidal “response”.</p> <p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a> President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/full-text-trumps-20-point-plan-end-war-gaza-0\">20-point “peace plan”</a> offers the farce: unapologetic gangsterism masquerading as a “solution” to the Gaza genocide. Former <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk\">British</a> Prime Minister Tony Blair - a war criminal who, alongside his US counterpart George W Bush, destroyed <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iraq\">Iraq</a> more than two decades ago - will issue diktats to the people of Gaza on Israel’s behalf.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Surrender document</h3> <p>Gaza, not just Hamas, faces an ultimatum: “Take the deal, or we will put you in concrete boots and sink you in the Mediterranean.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Barely veiled by the threat is the likelihood that, even if Hamas feels compelled to sign up to this surrender document, Gaza’s people will end up in concrete boots all the same.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gaza’s population is so desperate for a respite from the slaughter that it will accept almost anything. But it is pure delusion for the rest of us to believe a state that has spent two years carrying out a genocide can be trusted either to respect a ceasefire or to honour the terms of a peace plan, even one so heavily skewed in its favour. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>The farce of Trump’s peace plan - his “deal of the millennium” - is evident <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c70155nked7o\">from the first</a> of its 20 points: “Gaza will be a deradicalised terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbours.”&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/netanyahu-trump-plan-blueprint-dismantle-palestinian-identity\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/2025-09-26T201953Z_1188753643_RC2NZGAND21N_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-NEW-YORK%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=58qL4uk2\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Netanyahu-Trump plan: A blueprint to dismantle Palestinian identity</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/netanyahu-trump-plan-blueprint-dismantle-palestinian-identity\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>The document’s authors no more wonder what might have “radicalised” Gaza than western capitals did when Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist group in the UK and other countries, broke out of the prison enclave with great violence on 7 October 2023.</p> <p>Were the people of Gaza simply born radical, or did events turn them radical?&nbsp;Were they “radicalised” when Israel ethnically cleansed them from their original lands, in what is now the self-declared “Jewish state” of Israel, and dumped them in the tiny holding pen of Gaza?&nbsp;</p> <p>Were they “radicalised” by being surveilled and oppressed in a dystopian, open-air prison, decade upon decade?&nbsp;Was it the experience of living for 17 years under an Israeli land, sea and air blockade that denied them the right to travel or trade, and forced their children on to a diet that left them <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/content/israels-starvation-diet-gaza/11810\">malnourished</a>?</p> <p>Or maybe they were radicalised by the silence from Israel’s western patrons, who supplied the weaponry and lapped up the rewards: the latest confinement technologies, field-tested by Israel on the people of Gaza.</p> <p>The truth ignored in the opening point of Trump’s “peace plan” is that it is entirely normal to be “radicalised” when you live in an extreme situation. And there are no places on the planet more extreme than Gaza.</p> <h3>'Cockroaches' and 'snakes'</h3> <p>It is not Gaza that needs “deradicalising”. It is the West and its Israeli client state.&nbsp;</p> <p>The case for deradicalising Israel should hardly need stating. Poll after poll has shown Israelis are not just in favour of the annihilation their state is carrying out in Gaza; they believe their government needs to be even more aggressive, even more genocidal.</p> <p>This past May, as Palestinian babies were shrivelling into dry husks from Israel’s blockade on food and aid, 64 percent of Israelis <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/64-of-israelis-believe-there-are-no-innocents-in-gaza-poll/3594355\">said they believed</a> “there are no innocents” in Gaza, a place where around half of the population of two million people are children.&nbsp;</p> <p>The figure would be even higher were it reporting only the views of Israeli Jews. The survey included the fifth of the Israeli population who are Palestinians - survivors of mass expulsions in 1948 during Israel’s western-sponsored creation. This much-oppressed minority has been utterly ignored throughout these past two years.</p> <p></p> <p>Another <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-28/ty-article-magazine/.premium/yes-to-transfer-82-of-jewish-israelis-back-expelling-gazans/00000197-12a4-df22-a9d7-9ef6af930000\">survey</a> conducted earlier this year found that 82 percent of Israeli Jews favoured the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza. More than half, 56 percent, also supported the forced expulsion of Palestinian citizens of Israel - even though that minority has kept its head bowed throughout the genocide, for fear of reaping a whirlwind should it speak up.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition, 47 percent of Israeli Jews approved of killing all the inhabitants of Gaza, even its children.</p> <p>The crimes overseen by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is so often held up by outsiders as some kind of aberration, are entirely representative of wider public sentiment in Israel.&nbsp;</p> <p>The genocidal fervour in Israeli society is an open secret. Soldiers flood <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPE6vbKix6A\">social media</a> platforms with videos celebrating their war crimes. Teenage Israelis make funny <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-10-04/ty-article-opinion/.premium/inside-the-minds-of-young-israelis-mocking-gazas-suffering-on-tiktok/00000199-a61c-df33-a5dd-a67fbb890000\">videos on TikTok</a> endorsing the starvation of babies in Gaza. Israeli state TV <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUpm2jGJc18\">broadcasts</a> a child choir evangelising for Gaza’s annihilation.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>This is not just about a demon unleashed among Israelis. It is about a demon in the soul of the West</p> </blockquote> <p>Such views are not simply a response to the horrors that unfolded inside Israel on 7 October 2023. As polls have consistently shown,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society\">deep-seated racism</a> towards Palestinians is decades old.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is not former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant who started the trend of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2023/10/9/israeli-defence-minister-orders-complete-siege-on-gaza\">calling</a> Gaza’s Palestinians “human animals”. Politicians and religious leaders have been <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2009/01/the-palestinians-in-israeli-officials-own-words/\">depicting them</a> as “cockroaches”, “dogs”, “snakes” and “donkeys” since Israel’s creation. It is this long process of dehumanisation that made the genocide possible.</p> <p>In response to the outpouring of support in Israel for the extermination in Gaza, Orly Noy, a veteran Israeli journalist and activist, reached a <a href=\"https://www.972mag.com/israel-holocaust-gaza-denazification/\">painful conclusion</a> last month on the +972 website: “What we are witnessing is the final stage in the nazification of Israeli society.”</p> <p>And she noted that this problem derives from an ideology with a reach far beyond Israel itself: “The Gaza holocaust was made possible by the embrace of the ethno-supremacist logic inherent to Zionism. Therefore it must be said clearly: Zionism, in all its forms, cannot be cleansed of the stain of this crime. It must be brought to an end.”</p> <h3>Who needs deradicalising?&nbsp;</h3> <p>As the genocide has unfolded week after week, month after month - ever-more divorced from any link to 7 October 2023 - and western leaders have carried on justifying their inaction, a much deeper realisation is dawning.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is not just about a demon unleashed among Israelis. It is about a demon in the soul of the West. It is us - the power bloc that established Israel, arms Israel, funds Israel, indulges Israel, excuses Israel - that really needs deradicalising.&nbsp;</p> <p>Germany underwent a process of “denazification” following the end of the Second World War - a process, it is now clear from the German state’s feverish repression of any public opposition to the genocide in Gaza, that was never completed.</p> <p>A far deeper campaign of deradicalisation than the one Nazi Germany was subjected to, is now required in the West - one where normalising the murder of tens of thousands of children, live-streamed to our phones, can never be allowed to happen again.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/why-trump-blair-gaza-plan-is-unlawful\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/uk-blair-speaks-new-york-september-2022-john-lamparski-getty-images-afp.jpg.webp?itok=B9GvpuaB\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Why the Trump-Blair Gaza plan is unlawful</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/why-trump-blair-gaza-plan-is-unlawful\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>A deradicalisation that would make it impossible to conceive of our own citizens travelling to Israel to help take part in the Gaza genocide, and then be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/apr/07/ten-britons-accused-of-committing-war-crimes-while-fighting-for-israel-in-gaza\">welcomed back</a> to their home countries with open arms.&nbsp;</p> <p>A deradicalisation that would mean our governments could not contemplate silently abandoning their own citizens - citizens who joined an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/04/greta-thunberg-israel-gaza-sweden\">aid flotilla</a> to try to break Israel’s illegal starvation-siege of Gaza - to the goons of Israel’s fascist police minister.&nbsp;</p> <p>A deradicalisation that would make it inconceivable for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, or other western leaders, to <a href=\"https://www.declassifieduk.org/genocide-questions-avoided-as-starmer-meets-israeli-president/\">host Israel’s president</a>, Isaac Herzog, who at the outset of the slaughter in Gaza offered the central rationale for the genocide, arguing that no one there - not even its one million children - were innocent.&nbsp;</p> <p>A deradicalisation that would make it self-evident to western governments that they must uphold the World Court’s <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/icj-clears-fog-hiding-western-support-israel-rogue-state\">ruling last year</a>, not ignore it: that Israel must be forced to immediately end its decades-long illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories, and that they must carry out the arrest of Netanyahu on suspicion of crimes against humanity, as specified by the <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/defendant/netanyahu\">International Criminal Court</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>A deradicalisation that would make it preposterous for Shabana Mahmood, Britain’s home secretary, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/03/home-secretary-shabana-mahmood-says-pro-palestine-protests-in-wake-of-manchester-attack-are-un-british\">call demonstrations</a> against a two-year genocide “fundamentally un-British” - or to propose ending the long-held <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24rmdngrrjo\">right to protest</a>, but only when the injustice is so glaring, the crime so unconscionable, that it leads people to repeatedly protest.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Standing together</h3> <p>Mahmood justifies this near-death-knell erosion of the right to protest on the grounds that regular protests have a “cumulative impact”. She is right. They do: by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/05/police-to-get-new-powers-to-crack-down-on-repeated-protests-says-home-office\">exposing as a sham</a> our government’s claim to stand for human rights, and to represent anything more than naked, might-is-right politics.&nbsp;</p> <p>A deradicalisation is long overdue - and not just to halt the West’s crimes against the people of Gaza and the wider Middle East region.&nbsp;</p> <p>Already, as our leaders normalise their crimes abroad, they are normalising related crimes at home. The first signs are in the designation of opposition to genocide as “hate”, and of practical efforts to stop the genocide as “terrorism”.&nbsp;</p> <p>The intensifying campaign of demonisation will grow, as will the crackdown on fundamental and long-cherished rights.&nbsp;</p> <p>Israel has declared war on the Palestinian people. And our leaders are slowly declaring war on us, whether it be those protesting the Gaza genocide, or those opposed to a consumption-driven West’s genocide of the planet.&nbsp;</p> <p>We are being isolated, smeared and threatened.
