Their goal: to reach Jerusalem in search of work.</p> <p>But with <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\">Israeli</a> checkpoints and military closures paralysing movement for <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestinians</a> across the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/occupation\">occupied</a> West Bank, they were forced to take a dangerous route - scaling Israel’s separation wall.</p> <p>Sanad’s cousin, Hantouli Hantouli, told Middle East Eye the group used a ladder left by other Palestinian labourers in an attempt to climb the 10-metre-high barrier. When Hantouli slipped trying to ascend, Sanad stepped in.</p> <p>The 22-year-old successfully climbed the wall and used a rope to descend the other side. From there, he called up for the bags containing their clothes and belongings.</p> <p>“I started throwing the bags down to him after I reached the top of the wall,” said Hantouli. “Then I heard gunfire.”</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Seconds later, he heard Sanad scream.</p> <p>“I knew he’d been hit.

He ducked behind the barrier. Each time he raised his head, more shots rang out.</p> <p>Sanad lay on the ground, bleeding, for more than 30 minutes. Israeli forces prevented any medical attention. Residents who saw him from nearby buildings were unable to approach.</p> <p>“I started screaming hysterically when I saw his blood pouring out.

Hantouli watched as they turned him over, checking for bullet wounds. He had been shot twice - once in the side, and once in the thigh.</p> <p>“When they finally came over, I didn’t care any more what would happen to me.

At least 38 labourers have been killed, while thousands have been barred from crossing into Israel. Others have been pursued, arrested or shot.</p> <p>Before the genocide, Sanad held a permit to work inside Israel. But, like thousands of others, his permit was revoked after the start of the war, as Israeli authorities suspended all work permits for Palestinians, shut down crossings and imposed sweeping restrictions.</p> <blockquote> <p>'He felt he had no choice but to work, even if it meant risking his life by crossing the wall'</p> <p><em>-&nbsp;Yassin,&nbsp;Sanad Hantouli's cousin</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The economic impact on Palestinian families was immediate and devastating.</p> <p>With access cut off, many Palestinians have resorted to scaling the separation wall without permits. These attempts are often met with deadly force by Israeli soldiers.</p> <p>According to the General Union of Palestinian Workers, only about 25,000 Palestinians currently hold valid permits to work inside Israel.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most are employed in Palestinian institutions in occupied East Jerusalem, such as Al-Makassed and Augusta Victoria hospitals, or in Israeli-run businesses such as hotels and factories. A smaller number work in settlements.</p> <p>The number of Palestinians working without permits is estimated at between 25,000 and 30,000.</p> <p>Before the latest restrictions, the total number of Palestinian labourers - both with and without permits - was around 250,000.</p> <p>For Hantouli, the shooting of his cousin was deliberate.&nbsp;</p> <p>“They could have arrested him. But instead, they shot him and let him bleed. It was intentional,” he said.</p> <p>“We are all targets,” he added. “We just want to work and build a life, but the occupation doesn’t want us to live. My cousin died in front of me, and I could do nothing. If I had stayed near him, they would have shot me too.”</p> <h3>‘This is our tragedy’</h3> <p>In Sanad’s hometown of Silat al-Dhahr, near Jenin, news of his killing sparked widespread grief and outrage.</p> <p>The young man had left home early that morning hoping to earn money to support his struggling family of 11.</p> <p>“He was planning to get engaged soon, but he wanted to improve his financial situation first,” his cousin Yassin, who gave only his first name, told MEE.</p> <p>Sanad was the second eldest son in the family.

Only <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/jordan\">Jordan</a>, in control of central and eastern Palestine, which it annexed the following year and renamed \"the West Bank\", refused to extend recognition. The West soon recognised the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank, though not of East Jerusalem.</p> <p>Due to western hostility to the APG, and complicity in the division of Palestine between Israel and King Abdullah I of Jordan to prevent any Palestinian sovereignty, the APG faded and dissolved itself in 1953.</p> <p>In 1988, the Palestine National Council - the Palestinian parliament in exile, an organ of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - unilaterally declared \"independence\" in Algiers in support of the first Palestinian Uprising (1987-1993), which the PLO would ultimately crush as the price it pledged to pay for signing the 1993 Oslo Accord.</p> <p>While dozens of countries rushed to recognise that non-existent independent state, the United States adamantly refused.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a> had, in fact, been the party responsible for blocking Palestinian independence in 1947, when it <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_Haven_to_Conquest/HVVP0AEACAAJ?hl=en\">strong-armed</a> several countries to change their votes at the last minute and support UN General Assembly Resolution 181 - the Partition Plan.</p> <p>Thanks to American efforts, that plan awarded most of Palestine to the minority Jewish colonists, whose state the US recognised readily in May 1948.</p> <p>The US also made sure not to recognise the APG, a strategy it maintained by denying recognition to the PLO's declaration of independence in 1988.</p> <h3>After Oslo</h3> <p>After the 1993-94 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4LpZ0X-Vys\">Oslo Accords</a>, which created the Palestinian Authority (PA), negotiations with Israel on the core issues - independence, borders, Jerusalem and the return of refugees - never materialised, despite the passage of an agreed five-year interim period ending in May 1999.</p> <p>When no \"final status\" talks were even started, PA President Yasser Arafat <a href=\"https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/40640\">threatened</a> to declare the independence of Palestine in the entire West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza - territories where the PA exercised either extremely limited or no actual control.

Still, the slave-holding US refused to recognise it until 1862.</p> <p>In the case of the US, Greece and Haiti, those who declared independence were the ones who fought to evict the ruling empire from their state-to-be.</p> <p>In the case of the PA, however, the European imperial countries are seeking to grant recognition of an independent Palestinian state not to the resistance fighting the colonists, but to collaborators with Israeli colonialism and occupation.</p> <p>This may not be Meloni's point, but it should be the concern of those who think such recognition will end rather than deepen Israeli colonialism and control - and further strengthen their Palestinian collaborators.</p> <h3>Exercise in futility</h3> <p>After decades of denying Palestinians the right to independence, western imperialist states and white settler-colonies are now set to enlarge the number of countries recognising the Palestinian right to self-determination and statehood.</p> <p>But next week's conference will do no more than reassure Israel that its right to exist as a Jewish-supremacist state will be best guaranteed by its sponsors' recognition of a fictive Palestinian state.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/war-gaza-why-western-plans-another-palestinian-client-regime-will-fail\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Blinken%20Abbas%202024.jpg.webp?itok=tVqDgudG\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Why western plans for another Palestinian client regime will fail</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/war-gaza-why-western-plans-another-palestinian-client-regime-will-fail\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>The US and Israel refuse to accept \"yes\" for an answer, and believe that the Palestinians, including the collaborator PA, must be forever denied even a symbol of independence and a state.</p> <p>The Europeans and the Arab regimes driving this initiative, by contrast, believe that the trappings of \"independence\" are the best way to curtail Palestinian aspirations and derail their struggle for liberation into an illusion of statehood that does nothing to threaten Israeli Jewish supremacy.</p> <p>What will therefore remain of this international recognition is the part that affirms Israel as a Jewish-supremacist state existing alongside a non-existent Palestinian state that will never see the light.</p> <p>As I argued last year <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/instead-recognising-palestine-countries-should-withdraw-recognition-israel\">here</a>, the only way for these states to penalise Israel diplomatically is to withdraw recognition of Israel's right to be a Jewish-supremacist state, and to boycott it and impose international sanctions against it until it abrogates all its racist laws.</p> <p>Short of that, the entire conference is an exercise in futility and is further proof of the ongoing complicity of its participants in Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people.<br /> <br /> <em>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</em></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/palestine-state\" hreflang=\"en\">Palestine state</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
