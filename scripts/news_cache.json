One of seven children of a manual labourer, he had just turned eight when Israel began its ongoing occupation of the West Bank amid the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.&nbsp;</p> <p>Family members recount how his political awareness was formed from an early age, not least when Barghouti saw Israeli soldiers storm his village and shoot his dog.</p> <p>During his mid-teens, Barghouti joined Fatah, led by <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/complicated-legacy-yasser-arafat\">Yasser Arafat</a>, and the biggest group within the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. At this time, Fatah operated as an underground armed movement, frequently fighting Israeli forces occupying the West Bank.&nbsp;</p> <p>At 18, Barghouti was arrested by the Israeli authorities, and later said that he was beaten and tortured by the Israeli arresting officers.</p> <p>Barghouti told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/opinion/palestinian-hunger-strike-prisoners-call-for-justice.html\">The New York Times</a> in 2017: “An Israeli interrogator forced me to spread my legs while I stood naked in the interrogation room, before hitting my genitals.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"An Israeli border guard next to a wall plastered with pictures of Marwan Barghouti in Ramallah in August 2002 (AFP)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"An Israeli border guard next to a wall plastered with pictures of Marwan Barghouti in Ramallah in August 2002 (AFP)\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/palestine-west-bank-israel-soldier-marwan-barghouti-poster-august-2002-afp.jpg.webp?itok=L3Z8vbqb\" width=\"1400\" /> </div> <figcaption>An Israeli border guard stands next to a wall plastered with pictures of Marwan Barghouti in Ramallah in August 2002 (AFP)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>“The interrogator mocked me afterward, saying that I would never procreate because people like me give birth only to terrorists and murderers.”</p> <p>Convicted of taking part in insurgent activities against the Israeli occupation, he spent the next four-and-a-half years in prison.</p> <p>Following his release in 1983, Barghouti enrolled in Birzeit University outside Ramallah to study history and political science. He became a student activist and quickly rose within Fatah, facing several more arrests for activist activities before Israel deported him to Jordan in 1987.&nbsp;</p> <p>Months later, in December 1987, the First Intifada began and continued for five years. During this period, Barghouti was confined to rallying international support for the rebellion.</p> <p>Barghouti remained in exile until 1993, when his return to the West Bank was negotiated as part of the Oslo Accords peace process.</p> <h3>What did Barghouti do during the Second Intifada?</h3> <p>In 1994, following his return to the West Bank, Barghouti became a deputy to Arafat within Fatah’s innermost circle.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fatah was now engaging with Israeli officials openly, following the mutual recognition agreements negotiated by the Oslo Accords. But the expanding Israeli settlements and travel restrictions cemented by the accords left many Palestinians disillusioned with the peace process.</p> <p>The 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who had signed the accords, by an Israeli further exacerbated tensions.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Marwan Al-Barghouti answers questions during a press conference at the European parliament in Strasbourg, France, on 19 February 1997 (AFP) \" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"Marwan Al-Barghouti answers questions during a press conference at the European parliament in Strasbourg, France, on 19 February 1997 (AFP) \" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/strabsourg-frace-palestine-marwan-barghouti-february-1997-afp.jpg.webp?itok=dUyBxmPp\" width=\"1400\" /> </div> <figcaption>Marwan Barghouti answers questions during a press conference at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, on 19 February 1997 (AFP)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p>With Arafat increasingly blighted by the piecemeal accords he had negotiated, Barghouti’s profile grew as unrest swelled across the occupied Palestine.&nbsp;</p> <p>On 28 September 2000, Likud leader Ariel Sharon provoked Palestinians when &nbsp;he stormed the courtyards of Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of the holiest places in Islam. It sparked the Second Intifada, which was to last five years and in which Barghouti was a major leader.</p> <p>Ahmad Gloneim, a former member of Fatah’s Revolutionary Council with Barghouti during the Second Intifada, told MEE that during this period, “Barghouti began to be seen as a figure very close to the Palestinian people”.</p> <p>“He wasn’t the kind of leader who could spend his time travelling from capital to capital. He led demonstrations in a T-shirt and trousers, and was widely seen as a family man and a normal citizen,” Gloneim said.&nbsp;</p> <p>By the end of 2000, the Second Intifada had escalated from stone-throwing and civil disobedience to armed confrontation between the Israeli military and Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, and other Palestinian factions.</p> <p>Whether this move toward violence occurred under Barghouti’s direction is uncertain. Regardless, by 2002, Barghouti was a key target for Israeli forces, narrowly escaping several assassination attempts and spending long periods in hiding.&nbsp;</p> <p>Known for his calm demeanour, Barghouti once left hiding to visit his family. Gloneim, who was with him, remembers warning of an approaching Israeli tank. Barghouti replied: “Be quiet, you’ll scare the kids.”</p> <p>After suicide bombings and sniper <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/middle_east-jan-june02-mideast_03-03\">attacks</a> by Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades rocked Israel, Barghouti was tracked down through a wiretap and arrested by Israeli authorities.</p> <p>Tried in an Israeli court, Barghouti was convicted of planning attacks that killed five people and was sentenced to five life sentences for murder. Barghouti has long denied that he controlled Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a loose alliance of military groups linked to Fatah.</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Marwan Barghouti is led to a police vehicle after appearing before a Tel Aviv court in September 2003 (AFP)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"Marwan Barghouti is led to a police vehicle after appearing before a Tel Aviv court in September 2003 (AFP)\" height=\"980\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/israel-tel-aviv-marwan-barghouti-police-september-2003-afp.jpg.webp?itok=hNXjBtb9\" width=\"1400\" /> </div> <figcaption>Marwan Barghouti is led to a police vehicle after appearing before a Tel Aviv court in September 2003 (AFP)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>Disputing the legitimacy of Israel in the occupied Palestine, Barghouti offered no formal defence while also rejecting any link to the attacks.</p> <p>An inquiry by the Inter-Parliamentary Union <a href=\"http://archive.ipu.org/hr-e/174/report.htm\">found that</a> “numerous breaches of international law\" occurred during the trial.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nimer Sultany, reader in public law at the School of Oriental and African Studies&nbsp;in London and editor-in-chief of The Palestine Yearbook of International Law, told MEE that Barghouti faced a political trial.</p> <p>“Bargouthi’s trial highlighted the Israeli legal system’s criminalisation of the Palestinian resistance and its struggle for freedom from occupation and apartheid.</p> <p>“Although Bargouthi was the defendant, the real target was Yasser Arafat and the Second Intifada.&nbsp;Israel has long sought to stigmatise Palestinian leaders and activists under the labels of terrorism and criminality.”</p> <p>When Yasser Arafat died in 2004, Barghouti - the man long positioned as his heir - was in a maximum security Israeli prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2006, in his final TV interview to date, Barghouti discussed the charges with Britain’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPiVcaRGgSQ&amp;t=124s\">Channel 4 News</a>.</p> <p>“The Israelis consider everyone who opposes the occupation as a terrorist, but it’s not true. I don’t think the Israelis are suitable and qualified to describe people as that.”</p> <h3>What has happened to Barghouti since?</h3> <p>Barghouti has been imprisoned in Israel since 2002, shuffled between maximum security facilities.&nbsp;He has faced long periods of solitary confinement, including one lasting three years.</p> <p>Upon his release from solitary confinement, Barghouti began teaching university classes in prison.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2010, his PhD in political science was accepted by Cairo University (his lawyer smuggled out his thesis on Palestinian democracy, one page at a time).&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2017, while at Hadarim Prison, Barghouti led 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in a hunger strike over human rights abuses by Israel.&nbsp;</p> <p>In an op-ed for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/opinion/palestinian-hunger-strike-prisoners-call-for-justice.html\">The New York Times</a>, Barghouti wrote: “Israel has established a dual legal regime, a form of judicial apartheid, that provides virtual impunity for Israelis who commit crimes against Palestinians, while criminalizing Palestinian presence and resistance.</p> <p>“Israel’s courts are a charade of justice, clearly instruments of colonial, military occupation.”</p> <p>Like many Palestinian prisoners and detainees, Barghouti’s prison conditions have worsened since the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, according to his family and other inmates.</p> <p>They <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2024/07/22/marwan-barghouti-the-worlds-most-important-prisoner\">say</a> that Barghouti’s books were confiscated and his food and water rationed, causing him to lose 10kg.&nbsp;</p> <p>His access to family and legal visits has also been further restricted, with senior Palestinian figures <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-israel-endangering-marwan-barghouti-life-prison\">accusing</a> Israeli authorities of subjecting Barghouti to “isolation, torture and attempts to coerce, humiliate and beat him, putting his life in danger\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In August 2025, a 13-second <a href=\"https://x.com/MiddleEastEye/status/1956096150865342583\">clip</a> emerged of

Ben Gvir tells Barghouti: “Whoever messes with the people of Israel, whoever murders our children, whoever murders our women, we will obliterate them.”&nbsp;</p> <p>The clip marked the first images of Barghouti in almost a decade.&nbsp;</p> <p>In September 2025, Barghouti was beaten unconscious by eight Israeli prison guards while transferring prisons, according to Palestinian detainees released under the prisoner swap deal the following month.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://english.palinfo.com/news/2025/10/15/349860/\">Asra Media Office</a>, which covers Palestinian prisoner issues, said that Barghouti “lost consciousness and suffered fractures in four ribs as a result of the beating”.</p> <h3>What does Barghouti support?</h3> <p>It’s hard to discern Barghouti’s views on recent political developments, given that he has been barred from interviews throughout Israel’s genocide in Gaza.</p> <p>But he has long advocated direct rapprochement with Israeli officials and has supported the two-state solution.</p> <p>While imprisoned, Barghouti has learned fluent Hebrew and English, allowing him to engage with politicians from all sides.</p> <p>Former Likud finance minister Meir Sheetrit, who negotiated with Barghouti in the years following the Oslo Accords, told <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/1843/2024/07/22/marwan-barghouti-the-worlds-most-important-prisoner\">The Economist</a> in 2024: “He supported peace, totally. Real peace with Israel. We became really friendly.”</p> <p>In his final interview in 2006, Barghouti told Channel 4 News that he had urged Hamas to participate in democratic elections instead of armed struggle.&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>Referring to the murders and killings of Israeli civilians during the Second Intifada, Barghouti said: “Nobody can justify killing civilians, women and children anywhere in this world.&nbsp;</p> <p>“They should be outside of the game, in Palestine or in Israel.\"</p> <p>He added: “It’s a crime to kidnap journalists, or to kidnap foreigners. I condemn that, and hope they will not repeat that.”</p> <p>Instead, he said: “Palestinians must give a chance to any international [mediation] efforts, regional efforts, and we will do that.”</p> <p>But Barghouti also maintained: “The Palestinian people have the full right to resist the Israeli occupation.”</p> <h3>What's been said about Barghouti?</h3> <p>Calls for Barghouti’s release have been frequent during the past two decades, both in Palestine and beyond.</p> <p>He commands the respect of the leadership of Hamas, the political rival of Fatah, which has long advocated his release.</p> <p>During the 2011 prisoner exchange, when Yahya Sinwar, an architect of the October 7 attacks, was released, Hamas also sought for Barghouti to be freed. Israel refused.</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Palestinians attend a ceremony in Ramallah, occupied West Bank, marking the 21st anniversary of the arrest of Marwan, in May 2023 (AFP)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"Palestinians attend a ceremony in Ramallah, occupied West Bank, marking the 21st anniversary of the arrest of Marwan, in May 2023 (AFP)\" height=\"787\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/palestine-west-bank-ramallah-marwan-barghouti-21st-anniversary-may-2023-afp.JPG.webp?itok=sgLcyHdV\" width=\"1400\" /> </div> <figcaption>Palestinians attend a ceremony in Ramallah, occupied West Bank, marking the 21st anniversary of the arrest of Marwan, in May 2023 (AFP)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p>Hamas again called for Barghouti’s release during hostage-prisoner exchange negotiations in October 2025, as did <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/marwan-barghoutis-release-being-discussed-part-phase-two-ceasefire\">mediators</a> <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt\">Egypt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/qatar\">Qatar</a>.</p> <p>But Barghouti is perhaps the most valuable of all the Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p> <p>A source close to Barghouti’s family <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/marwan-barghouti-will-not-be-released-gaza-deal-says-israeli-spokesperson\">told</a> Middle East Eye that mediators, including US envoy Steve Witkoff, signed off on a prisoner list that included Barghouti, before his name was unilaterally removed by the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office at the last minute.</p> <p>According to Israel’s Channel 14, Barghouti's freedom is a red line for Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has long opposed the two-state solution in favour of Israeli <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-palestine-ben-gvir-annex-west-bank-b2831067.html\">annexation</a> of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ben Gvir could imperil Benjamin Netanyahu's government if he pulls his MPs from the governing Likud coalition.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet several leading Israeli politicians have called for Barghouti to be freed. In 2007, Shimon Peres said he would pardon Barghouti if elected, only to renege on the promise when he was elected later that year.</p> <p>More recently, intelligence figures such as former Shin Bet head <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/former-shint-bet-chief-calls-release-hostages-exchange-palestinian-0\">Ami Ayalon</a> and former Mossad director <a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250205-marwan-barghouti-should-be-freed-by-israel-immediately-says-ex-mossad-head/\">Efraim Halevy</a> have called for Barghouti’s release.&nbsp;</p> <p>In an interview with Israel’s UBS public radio in February 2025, Halevy said: “Barghouti is popular with his people, he has a clear position, he speaks Hebrew well and can negotiate, all of which qualifies him to lead a new path.”</p> <h3>What now for Barghouti?</h3> <p>No date has been set for Barghouti’s release. And with the remaining Israeli hostages freed from Gaza as part of the ceasefire deal, Palestinian groups now have less bargaining power to push for the release of Palestinians in Israeli jails.</p> <p>Overseas, there are calls for his release. In the UK, for example, both the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/green-mp-raises-marwan-barghoutis-release-uk-parliament\">Green Party</a> and the <a href=\"https://ldfp.org.uk/arab-barghouti-meets-lib-dem-parliamentarians/\">Liberal Democrats</a> have separately raised his case with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p> <p>But many in Israel and Palestine would rather he stay in jail.</p> <p>He is certainly regarded as an electoral threat to incumbent Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, who is hugely <a href=\"https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/997\">unpopular</a>&nbsp;and who turns 90 in November.</p> <p>And for Israelis who support annexation of the West Bank , Barghouti’s support of a negotiated two-state settlement is regarded as a threat.</p> <p>Arab Barghouti, Barghouti’s son, told Middle East Eye that recent assaults on Barghouti in prison represent a clear threat to his life and that only pressure from the international community would ensure his survival.</p> <p>“We’ve already lost 76 Palestinian political prisoners inside prison, and we are not going to wait for my father to lose his life.</p> <p>“This is a unifying figure, a leader that is trusted by all the Palestinian people, and that is exactly why he represents a threat to the current Israeli government.”</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/profiles/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Profiles</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\" title=\"4 May 2020 21:29 BST\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

But they had more urgent problems.</p> <p>The village, which has a predominantly Christian population of around 1,300 people, is subject to a reign of terror. October is the olive harvesting season, but its residents risk settler assault if they go into their land to pluck the fruit.</p> <p>As with all <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestinian</a> villages, gates have been installed at the village entrance to enable the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\">Israeli</a> army to cut off access at a moment's notice.</p> <p>Youssef Moussa, a 64-year-old Bedouin man, told us how a settler militia broke into his tent while his family was asleep two weeks ago.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>They beat him unconscious, breaking two of his ribs.

Last weekend saw a <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-10-12/ty-article/.premium/settlers-attack-palestinian-farmers-in-west-bank-idf-fires-tear-gas/00000199-d35c-d8a7-afdd-f7fdbcfd0000\">wave of assaults</a> on Palestinian farmers across the northern West Bank around Aqraba, Burqa, al-Zawiya and Beita.</p> <p>The settlers have almost complete impunity. If Palestinians complain to the police to defend them, no one comes.</p> <p>If they defend themselves, settlers call in the army.</p> <p>This state-sponsored campaign has one overwhelming objective: to eradicate the Palestinian communities that have existed in this area for generations.</p> <p>These communities long predate the predatory settlers -&nbsp;an illegal presence in Palestine that first arrived with the Israeli occupation following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.</p> <p>Last month, Smotrich <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israels-smotrich-unveils-plan-annex-majority-west-bank\">set out his plan</a> to annex 82 percent of what he calls Judea and Samaria.</p> <p>Under his vision, Palestinians would be herded into isolated islands in Palestine’s larger towns. If realised, it would make the much vaunted two-state solution, supported by Britain and other western states, quite impossible.</p> <p>This is entirely by design. Announcing the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-approves-e1-settlement-smotrich-says-palestinian-state-being-erased\">approval</a> of the E1 settlement project in August - a plan to build more than 3,000 homes that would effectively cut off the West Bank from occupied East Jerusalem - Smotrich stated as much.</p> <p>“The Palestinian state is being erased from the table, not with slogans but with actions. Every settlement, every neighbourhood, every housing unit is another nail in the coffin of this dangerous idea,” he said.</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"US Ambassador Mike Huckabee visited Taybeh in July (AFP)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"US Ambassador Mike Huckabee visited Taybeh in July (AFP)\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/palestine-west-bank-taybeh-huckabee-july-2025-afp.jpg\" width=\"1920\" /> </div> <figcaption>US Ambassador Mike Huckabee (second left) visits the West Bank town of Taybeh in July following an arson attack by Israeli settlers (Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>This explains why the Smotrich plan has not been welcomed by the West. Smotrich’s vision of annexation of the West Bank is already well underway.</p> <p>The&nbsp;Economist&nbsp;magazine, a strong supporter of Israel and no friend to Palestinians, recently <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/4.%09https:/www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2025/09/18/palestine-is-unrecognisable-on-the-ground\">observed</a>: “In reality, annexation has already happened.”</p> <p>Anybody who lives in Taybeh can see this for themselves.</p> <p>An ancient church stands at the summit of the village. It commands an imposing view over pastoral land across the northern West Bank towards Jericho, the Jordan Valley and beyond.</p> <p>There, the farmers, herders and nomadic Bedouin tribes have been driven off the land in the frenzied wave of brutal attacks and bloodletting under the cover of the Gaza genocide over the last two years.</p> <p>Taybeh's status as one of the few Christian-majority villages in the West Bank affords it attention that other villages cannot command.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-settlers-and-military-raid-palestinian-christian-village-occupied-west-bank\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/taybeh%20settler%20attack%201.jpg.webp?itok=KI-GK3N2\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Israeli settlers repeat attack on Palestinian Christian village in West Bank</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-settlers-and-military-raid-palestinian-christian-village-occupied-west-bank\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>In July, the village was visited by Mike Huckabee - the US ambassador to, and staunch supporter of, Israel - in the aftermath of an arson attack targeting the fifth-century Al-Khader church.</p> <p>Huckabee called for those who had committed \"acts of terror and violence\" to be found and prosecuted.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://il.usembassy.gov/statement-by-u-s-ambassador-mike-huckabee/\">statement</a>, he pledged \"solidarity with the people who just want to live their lives in peace, be able to go to their own land, be able to go to their place of worship. This is a Christian community, largely, and it’s one that deserves respect and deserves to be treated with dignity.&nbsp; Nothing short of that\".</p> <p>In the following days, further high-profile visitors to the village included US senators&nbsp;Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley, and German Foreign Minister&nbsp;Johann Wadephul.</p> <p>But their visits did little to deter further violence.&nbsp;Now, the attacks are coming into the heart of these villages. There have been repeated attacks within the village of Taybeh itself.&nbsp;</p> <p>The setters walk with impunity through the village, setting fire to homes and olive groves. They also target Taybeh’s ancient religious and cultural heritage, with its roots in the Byzantine era.</p> <p>Leaving aside the humanitarian catastrophe, we are talking about an act of gross cultural destruction.</p> <p>When the attacks come, Israeli soldiers stationed nearby either fail to answer calls for help or come to the aid of the settlers.</p> <p>The plight of Taybeh is typical of what the Bethlehem-based human rights group Balasan <a href=\"https://balasan.org/update-settler-violence-as-a-tool-of-erasing-palestinian-christian-heritage-in-the-west-bank-the-case-of-taybeh/\">calls</a> a “deliberate Israeli policy of forced displacement”.&nbsp;</p> <p>Balasan adds that this policy “is strictly prohibited under international law and constitutes a grave violation, amounting to a war crime. Under international humanitarian law, Israel, as the occupying power, has an obligation to ensure the protection of the civilian population in the occupied territory”.</p> <p><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">Israeli human rights group B’Tselem&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/settler_violence_updates_list?importance=1\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a>&nbsp;that the primary goal is to “drive Palestinians off the land and seize as much territory as possible”.</span></p> <p>It adds: “The violence perpetrated by settlers living in these outposts has escalated sharply, reaching unprecedented levels during the months of Israel’s assault on Gaza.</p> <p>\"This terrifying daily routine includes severe physical assaults, settler incursions into communities and homes at all hours, arson, expulsion of shepherds from pastureland and farmers from their fields, killing and theft of livestock, destruction of crops, theft of equipment and personal belongings, and blocking of access roads.”</p> <p>This has been the daily life of Palestinians across the West Bank for the last two years. Yet the demographic transformation has either been ignored or under-reported.</p> <p>Shockingly, there is no mention of Israel’s forced displacement of Palestinians across the West Bank in Donald Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza.</p> <p>This is a glaring omission. The American president claims that the war in Gaza is over.</p> <p>Yet there is no chance at all of long-term peace unless Israel is forced to end its war crimes across the West Bank.</p> <p>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the omission is deliberate - or at least highly convenient for Smotrich and his fellow fascists, who it is reasonable to speculate would have imposed a price in exchange for their support of the ceasefire in Gaza.</p> <p>On the ground in Taybeh and other West Bank communities under siege, they have been given free rein to carry on the illegal and murderous task of ethnically cleansing Palestinians from their land.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/occupation\" hreflang=\"en\">Occupation</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor\"> <div><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/users/peter-oborne\" hreflang=\"en\">Peter Oborne</a></div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div>Taybeh, Occupied Palestine</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
