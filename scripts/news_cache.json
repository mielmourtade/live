American Israeli Holocaust historian Omer Bartov said the idea “was a <a href=\"https://newlinesmag.com/argument/the-dam-of-gaza-genocide-denial-has-broken/\">painful conclusion</a> to reach, and one I resisted as long as I could”.</p> <p>But now that there is very wide agreement <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/video/video-israel-committing-genocide-legal-and-holocaust-scholars-agree\">about the Gaza genocide</a>, what do we make of those who still “disagree”?&nbsp;</p> <p>Clearly, genocide is a legal term, and although it is defined quite simply in the Genocide Convention, ICJ judgements have complicated its interpretation, and some observers still have technical reservations about its legal application.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Most who disagree, however, are not primarily concerned with technicalities, even if they use technical arguments. Those who used to say: “I’m worried by what Israel’s doing but I’m not sure it’s genocide”, now agree it’s genocide - or at the least, they will “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/opinion/international-world/friedman-israel-gaza-hamas.html\">leave it to historians to debate</a>”.</p> <p>Today, politicians and commentators who actively continue to disagree with the genocide label are mostly those who are not appalled by Israel’s actions. It’s actually quite simple to test whether “genocide disagreement” is really technical - or whether it amounts to denying the atrocities that it describes.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Crimes against humanity</h3> <p>If an honest observer has really taken the measure of Israel’s actions over the past two years, they should easily agree that it is guilty of massive crimes against humanity and war crimes.&nbsp;</p> <p>But scratch the surface of a public genocide denier, and you are unlikely to find burning outrage about the use of starvation as a method of war, intentional attacks on the civilian population, and murder, persecution and other inhumane acts - the charges facing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the International Criminal Court (ICC).&nbsp;</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/israel-rejects-hamas-truce-offer-thousands-forced-flee-gaza-city\"><b><i>Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine war</i></b></a></p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <hr /> <p>Since denial of “genocide” is now denial of the full horrors of Israeli atrocities, there is little point in pulling our punches about the genocide charge. It brings together Israel’s crimes, forcing everyone to look at its overall policy in a holistic way (which is why Jewish lawyer <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/definition\">Raphael Lemkin</a> first argued that we needed a crime of genocide).&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges\">The ICC itself said</a>, when issuing its warrants against Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, that the discrete crimes listed were parts of a single “widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population”.&nbsp;</p> <p>Looking at Israel’s actions this way, we can see that - as the new UN report confirms - its many crimes are part of a general, intentional policy to destroy <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestinian</a> society in Gaza.</p> <blockquote> <p>Disagreement is not an honest choice, but a way to avoid doing anything serious to stop Israel's violence in Gaza</p> </blockquote> <p>Secondly, recognising Israel’s genocide comes with a universal obligation - on all <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/legal/ratification\">153 states</a> that have signed the Genocide Convention - to “prevent and punish” this crime. So far, even states that oppose Israel’s campaign have hardly taken robust action to try to stop it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although South Africa deserves great credit for its pioneering case at the ICJ, neither it, nor any other state, nor the judges - who in 2024 issued three orders to Israel to allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza freely - have followed up on its brazen defiance of the court’s orders.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most western governments remain determined to disagree with the genocide characterisation, even as they belatedly criticise Israel. Here, disagreement is not an honest choice, but a way to avoid doing anything serious to stop Israel’s violence in Gaza.&nbsp;</p> <p>These states remain allied to Israel and give it tacit support - thus opening their leaders up to potential charges of complicity and even conspiracy to commit genocide.</p> <h3>Moral vacuum</h3> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk\">UK</a> demonstrates the moral vacuum of official western “disagreement” in particularly stark form. As the enormity of Israel’s actions has become clearer, the Labour government’s position, restated earlier this month, is that it “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/09/uk-not-concluded-israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-lammy-says\">has not concluded</a>” that Israel is acting with genocidal intent in Gaza.&nbsp;</p> <p>The obfuscation is very revealing. Although interpreted by some as straightforward denial, it actually shows that while the government will not recognise Israel’s genocide, it also cannot bring itself to directly deny it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rather, it wants to permanently avoid reaching a conclusion, even resorting to specious arguments, such as that it is a matter for international courts - which makes a mockery of the imperative for signatory states to actively “prevent” genocide.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-video mee-readmore-type-video align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/video/gaza-genocide-strongest-case-world-court-william-schabas-expert-witness#autoplay\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/video_thumbnails/1s4LKr3qK4M.jpg.webp?itok=e1qpqRV9\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Why Gaza genocide is strongest case before ICJ | William Schabas | Expert Witness</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/video/gaza-genocide-strongest-case-world-court-william-schabas-expert-witness#autoplay\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>In reality, ministers understand all too well the legal stakes involved. David Lammy, now justice minister, who signed the recent statement, was embarrassed by <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2024/10/30/david-lammy-sounds-increasingly-stupid-for-refusing-to-say-genocide/\">ill-thought-out comments</a> in 2024.&nbsp;</p> <p>The attorney general, Richard Hermer, who <a href=\"https://bylinetimes.com/2025/06/05/the-gaza-genocide-and-the-double-standards-of-the-uk-governments-commitment-to-international-law/\">presents himself</a> as an upholder of international law, claims that the government’s policy, for example on supplying weapons to Israel, is determined purely on the law. But not reaching a decision on the duty to prevent genocide, 20 months after the ICJ warned of the risk, is hardly a technical legal choice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Above all, Prime Minister Keir Starmer himself, who only 11 years ago <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/starmer-argued-serbia-waged-genocide-against-croatia\">prosecuted another genocide case</a> before the ICJ, understands all too well that Gaza is a case of genocide too. That is why, while disagreeing with the genocide charge, he has never provided an explanation.</p> <p>As Gaza’s cities are completely destroyed, and its surviving people are herded towards concentration camps and face expulsion, the middle ground between supporting and opposing genocide has disappeared. After two years, criticism of Israel that still “disagrees” with the genocide charge represents little more than complicity in Israel’s atrocities.</p> <p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

Despite this, Israel continues to bomb Lebanon, occupy areas in the south and violate the country’s airspace on a daily basis.</p> <p>Survivors and the families of the people who were killed believe they had been victims of a&nbsp;“terrorist attack”. Rights and legal organisations have meanwhile sounded the alarm over the illegality of these operations.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ramzi Kaiss, a Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch, says international humanitarian law prohibits booby traps designed to lure civilians, including everyday objects such as pagers used in medical and other civilian contexts.</p> <p>“In the case of the pager attacks, yes,Hezbollah said that the pagers belonged to employees of various Hezbollah institutions, but not necessarily its military wing,” Kaiss tells MEE.&nbsp;</p> <p>In any case, the attack was “unlawfully indiscriminate”, Kaiss added, as the thousands of devices exploded near simultaneously, making it impossible to ascertain the locations of every intended victim,&nbsp;whether fighter or civilian.&nbsp;</p> <h3>'Everything just went black. Black, black'</h3> <p>At a physiotherapy clinic just outside Tyre, in southern Lebanon, 21-year-old Sarah Jaffal is learning to use her hands again.</p> <p>With the help of her therapist one morning in April, she squeezes a metal spring device, then a foam ball.

A family member’s pager sat unattended nearby. Suddenly, she heard a “weird, strong sound” coming from the device, which also showed an “error” message.&nbsp;</p> <p>The next few seconds are erased from her memory.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I didn’t hear anything or feel anything…everything just went black. Black, black.”</p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>It wasn’t until the paramedics arrived that Sarah began to feel the pain of the hundreds of bits of white-hot shrapnel that had just torn through her face and hands.</p> <p>She had been taken all the way to a hospital in Beirut, then to <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iran\">Iran</a> to undergo dozens of operations. There, she kept her spirits up by teaching the nurses English in exchange for Farsi lessons. She and the others there who had been wounded by the pager attacks became fast friends. “There was pain, but also joy.”</p> <figure class=\"align-center media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Sarah Jaffal sits across her physiotherapist during their regular sessions to rehabilitate her strength and dexterity after being seriously wounded by a pager's explosion (João Sousa/MEE)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"Sarah Jaffal sits across her physiotherapist during their regular sessions to rehabilitate her strength and dexterity after being seriously wounded by a pager's explosion (João Sousa/MEE)\" height=\"1733\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/sarah-jaffal-physiotherapy-pager-attack-joao-sousa-mee-lebanon.jpg\" width=\"2600\" /> </div> <figcaption>Sarah Jaffal sits across her physiotherapist during their regular sessions to rehabilitate her strength and dexterity after being seriously wounded by a pager's explosion (João Sousa/MEE)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p>In all, Sarah lost several fingers and one of her eyes. She’s also still receiving laser treatments to remove the bits of plastic shrapnel embedded in her face, with Hezbollah covering the cost.</p> <p>Smiling, she’s adamant that she isn’t discouraged by the experience, and hopes to start a master’s degree in data science.</p> <p>“I’m not weak, I’m going to keep going. I’m not someone who is going to just stay at home and call it quits.</p> <p>“My life doesn’t stop here.”</p> <h3>A cemetery where Fatima now rests</h3> <p>As Sarah heals, other families are still deep in mourning.</p> <p>Among them are the loved ones of nine-year-old Fatima Abdallah, the youngest victim of the pager attacks.</p> <p>On 17 September 2024, she was sitting on her own in the kitchen of her family home in the Bekaa Valley when a relative’s pager began to beep near her. When she moved closer to check it out, the device exploded, instantly killing her.</p> <p>“She had just come home from school and was all alone,” one of her older brothers tells MEE from the family home.</p> <figure class=\"align-center media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"The tomb of Fatima Abdallah, 9, killed by a pager's explosion while sitting alone in her kitchen (João Sousa/MEE)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"The tomb of Fatima Abdallah, 9, killed by a pager's explosion while sitting alone in her kitchen (João Sousa/MEE)\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/fatima-abdallah-grave-victim-pager-attack-lebanon-joao-sousa-mee-sep-2025.jpg\" width=\"2000\" /> </div> <figcaption>The tomb of nine-year-old Fatima Abdallah, killed by a pager's explosion while sitting alone in her kitchen (Joao Sousa/MEE)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>It is a story that still hurts the family deeply.</p> <p>“It’s difficult,” her brother says quietly. Her loss has left behind a lasting wound.</p> <p>“Everyone loved her…she was smart. She had memorised the Quran. She was a role model for the other girls. They would say: ‘I want to memorise the Quran like Fatima.’”</p> <p>In their living room, Fatima’s family set up a small memorial, displaying her scout uniform in a glass case.</p> <p>Below the family house, in a spot visible from the window, is the cemetery where Fatima now rests.</p> <h3>Scarred and blinded</h3> <p>Many survivors are simply trying to move on with life despite their profound physical and psychological injuries. Hassan Bahsoun, 17 years old, was severely wounded in the face when his father’s pager exploded last year.</p> <p>Hassan's home in Tayr Debba, a village in the hills above Tyre, overlooks the valleys where residents can see one of the eight Israeli military outposts illegally occupying southern Lebanon.</p> <p>It was early afternoon, and Hassan was home with his family.</p> <p>“The pager was on the table. My father got up and left it there, and the moment he did, it started making a noise and vibrating as if it was dancing on the table,” Hassan tells MEE.</p> <p>Suddenly, a huge explosion.</p> <figure class=\"align-center media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Hassan Bahsoun, 17, blinded by the pager attack, sits in his living room in Tayr Debba, Southern Lebanon (Joao Sousa/MEE)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"Hassan Bahsoun, 17, blinded by the pager attack, sits in his living room in Tayr Debba, Southern Lebanon (Joao Sousa/MEE)\" height=\"2600\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/hassan-bahsoun-survivor-pagers-attack-lebanon-sept-2025-joao-sousa-mee.jpg\" width=\"3900\" /> </div> <figcaption>Hassan Bahsoun, 17, blinded by the pager attack, sits in his living room in Tayr Debba, southern Lebanon (Joao Sousa/MEE)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>“It also hurt my 16-year-old brother, who was hit by shrapnel to the face.”</p> <p>Hassan’s wounds were more serious. He was left blinded in both eyes, with scars criss-crossing his face.</p> <p>“If the pager had been closer to me, I would have died,” he says.</p> <p>Despite the devastating injuries, he was one of a slew of Lebanese high school students from the south who earned top marks on the recent national exams.</p> <p>It’s still a long road to full recovery. “I had 10 surgeries, but there are still some pieces of shrapnel in my face,” he says. “And my hands are still in pain.”&nbsp;</p> <p>He will never regain his eyesight.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Fresh headstone, wilted roses</h3> <p>Ahmad says he is hoping for legal recourse for his sister Ataa’s killing. “I want justice.”</p> <p>That could prove difficult - Lebanon is not party to the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 1998. That means there is no clear avenue yet for Lebanese citizens to seek justice in the aftermath of the pager attacks.</p> <p>“The ICC doesn’t have jurisdiction over Lebanese territory,” HRW’s Kaiss says. “It can’t investigate or prosecute violations that occurred in Lebanon.”&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"align-center media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"The mother of Ataa Mubarak, 28-year-old nurse killed in the pagers attack, holds her daughter's framed portrait (João Sousa/MEE)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"The mother of Ataa Mubarak, 28-year-old nurse killed in the pagers attack, holds her daughter's framed portrait (João Sousa/MEE)\" height=\"1733\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/mother-of-ataa-nurse-killed-pager-attack-south-lebanon-joao-sousa-mee-sep-2025.jpg\" width=\"2600\" /> </div> <figcaption>The mother of Ataa Mubarak, 28-year-old nurse killed in the pager attack, holds her daughter's framed portrait (Joao Sousa/MEE)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>Still, he adds, Lebanon could seek to provide retroactive jurisdiction to the ICC, to cover past war crimes. Last April, the government did make moves to give ICC jurisdiction, but eventually withdrew the decision.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nevertheless, Ahmad is still hoping for some form of justice, in memory of Ataa.</p> <p>“I never remember her not smiling,” he says. At times, he still speaks of her in the present tense, as if the shock of her death is still too much to bear.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet, at the cemetery nearby, Ataa’s portrait smiles warmly atop a fresh headstone. Wilted roses surround the picture.</p> <p>“She’s always there for people,” Ahmad says. “She took care of everyone.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/users/madeline-edwards\">Madeline Edwards</a>.</em></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-war-lebanon\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's war on Lebanon</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor\"> <div><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/users/soha-sayed\" hreflang=\"en\">Soha Sayed</a></div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> Beirut</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> Beirut</div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
