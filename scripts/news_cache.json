Authorities have since allowed rallies to proceed peacefully while tightly monitoring major city arteries and maintaining a visible presence.</p> <p>The easing of security pressure was largely forced by huge public outrage, while the urban unrest drew international media attention squarely onto Morocco’s domestic scene.</p> <p>GenZ 212 has emphasized its peaceful intent both in its written statements and during its daily gatherings, such as in Casablanca on Saturday, where one of the speakers standing on the public bench took the floor to salute the security forces.</p> <p>“They too are sons of this nation, ordinary people like us, and just as concerned as we are,” he says from his platform.</p> <h3>Stadiums rise, living standards fall</h3> <p>Against the backdrop of a picturesque sunset, strollers join the crowd already gathered, and they clap along to show support for the demands.</p> <p>Families are there too. A mother gently scolds her little boy as he darts through the crowd, dancing wildly to the rhythm of the chants: “No health, no education, but the stadiums are top-notch!”</p> <p>GenZ 212, which describes itself as a \"space for discussion\" on \"issues that concern all citizens, such as health, education and the fight against corruption\", has emerged at a time when socioeconomic conditions are deteriorating for most Moroccans.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/what-genz-212-group-behind-protests-morocco\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Morocco-protest-%20GenZ%20212-Rabat-29-September-2025-Bziouat-AFP.jpg.webp?itok=EVl2En42\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">What is GenZ 212, the group behind the protests in Morocco?</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/what-genz-212-group-behind-protests-morocco\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Fuel prices have surged since 2022, while the worst drought in over three decades has depleted water reserves in dams and aquifers, pushing up <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/eid-al-adha-moroccans-asked-abstain-sacrifice-faith-meets-financial-reality\">food prices</a> and worsening living conditions in peripheral areas.</p> <p>On 11 August, the city of Khouribga was banned from holding a citizen protest against the failing water supply, which suffers from poor quality and frequent cuts.</p> <p>A metric from the High Commission for Planning <a href=\"https://www.hcp.ma/file/244832/\">highlights</a> the trend: 76 percent of Moroccan households report that their standard of living has declined over the past 12 months, reflecting a steady drop in purchasing power across the country.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the privatisation of the education and health sectors is accelerating. The pivotal project to expand health insurance coverage is failing to address a growing fragmentation of the healthcare system following the 2015 market opening, which allowed private investors into clinics.</p> <p>This shift has emphasised territorial disparities in coverage and indirectly benefited private establishments, while public hospitals struggle with deteriorating services.</p> <p>The systemic challenges of national policy manifest in local incidents where the gaps in healthcare access become tragically tangible.</p> <p>By mid-September, a grisly streak of deaths at a hospital in Agadir underscored this human cost: eight pregnant women admitted for caesarean sections died, prompting citizen sit-ins and becoming emblematic of the failures of the public healthcare system.</p> <p>The shiny inauguration of Rabat’s renovated Moulay Abdallah Stadium in early September set the discordant tone for outbreak of unrest that followed. Completed in a record 18 months, it coincided with the second anniversary of the al-Haouz <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/morocco-one-year-after-earthquake-rebuilding-feeling-left-behind\">earthquake</a>, with many victims still bracing themselves to face a third winter in tents.</p> <p>Morocco has turned sport into a showcase of its economic ambitions and a pillar of its nation-branding strategy, pouring at least $5bn into preparations for the 2030 World Cup it will co-host with Spain and Portugal.</p> <blockquote> <p>‘I only wish the best for my country. It’s good that the youth are expressing the frustration we all share’</p> <p><em>- Abdallah, middle-aged</em>&nbsp;<em>protestor</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Yet the clustering of four stadiums in Rabat lays bare the widening gap between flagship projects polished to attract investors and tourists, and the daily hardships faced by most Moroccans.</p> <p>While this grand vision plays out on a national stage, local communities feel the immediate impact.</p> <p>In Benslimane, residents must make way for what is touted as the world’s largest stadium, budgeted at $500m. In September, parents <a href=\"https://barlamantoday.com/2025/09/10/parents-protest-demolition-of-beni-amer-school-in-benslimane/\">protested</a> the planned demolition of a school after authorities instructed them to enrol their children in four alternative schools located more than 10km away.</p> <p>This local case underscores Morocco’s uneven development, leaving segments of the population sidelined in the race for growth. Youth bear the brunt: in 2025, nearly 22 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds remain unemployed, according to official <a href=\"https://www.hcp.ma/La-situation-du-marche-du-travail-au-deuxieme-trimestre-de-2025_a4163.html\">figures</a>.</p> <p>The contrast between Morocco’s curated international image and on-the-ground realities, along with the punitive handling of popular protests, inspired an online commentator to a striking <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPJ3D9eCGgk/?igsh=MWE5NDRnb3NuMDV5bw==\">comparison</a>.</p> <p>“The Moroccan government acts like a Moroccan mother receiving guests, scolding her children to behave and not eat too much, and replacing the old living-room mattresses so they don’t ruin the decor,” he wrote on Instagram.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <h3>‘It damages the country’s image’</h3> <p>In Casablanca, Abdallah, now retired, decided to attend the protest with his 15-year-old daughter to show he shares the young organisers’ demands. &nbsp;</p> <p>“I only wish the best for my country. It’s good that the youth are expressing the frustration we all share,” he tells MEE.</p> <p>“However, at some point, there will have to be some structure, so that real dialogue with the authorities can take place,” he adds.</p> <p>On Thursday, GenZ 212 <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/moroccos-protest-movement-calls-king-dissolve-government\">released</a> a statement addressed to King Mohammed VI, calling for the dismissal of the government “for its failure to protect the constitutional rights of Moroccans and respond to their social demands\".</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/calls-genz-protests-algeria-framed-media-moroccan-plot\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Moroccan-protests-genz-security-forces-Rabat-2-October-2025-Bziouat-AFP.jpg.webp?itok=CaPESgxc\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Calls for GenZ protests in Algeria framed in media as Moroccan plot</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/calls-genz-protests-algeria-framed-media-moroccan-plot\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>It also called for the launch of a \"fair judicial process\" to prosecute those responsible for corruption.</p> <p>Earlier, Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch expressed the government's willingness to \"respond to the social demands\" of the young demonstrators and its \"readiness for dialogue\".</p> <p>The current prime minister, a business billionaire, is seen by Moroccans as an epitome of the country’s inequalities. He notably controls the country’s leading hydrocarbon distribution group and one of its largest agribusiness conglomerates.</p> <p>GenZ 212, which has attracted over 180,000 new members on its Discord page in just a fortnight, is <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/what-genz-212-group-behind-protests-morocco\">anonymous</a> and leaderless. It presents itself as apolitical and rejects any form of centralisation or mediation through intermediary bodies, whether unions or political parties.</p> <p>These characteristics could make it difficult for authorities to negotiate with or co-opt its members, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/29/gen-z-protesters-rally-across-morocco-demanding-health-education-reforms\">according</a> to analysts, even as they try to deflate the movement by redirecting its momentum through established, conventional institutional channels.</p> <p>The protest movement, which comes from a generation born between the late 1990s and early 2010s - raised on the instant connectivity of social media and amplified by the decentralised nature of Discord servers, stands in contrast to its predecessors, such as the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/inside-movement-what-left-moroccos-february-20\">February 20 Movement</a>, which shook the country in the wake of the 2011 uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa.</p> <p>Yet, the sediments of past popular struggles run through the protest culture of these youth.</p> <p>The wide repertoire of chants bears the imprint of symbols inherited from the litany of aborted popular movements in Morocco’s contemporary history, the most recent being the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/morocco-upholds-sentences-against-hirak-protesters\">Rif Hirak</a>, which saw the northern marginalised region rise in 2019.</p> <p>“Zefzafi, be at peace, we are taking on the struggle!” the crowd shouts, invoking Nasser Zefzafi, the prominent Rif Hirak leader sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the night deepens in the Ain Diab neighbourhood of Casablanca, the public speakers urge the crowd to disperse in an orderly manner while members of the core protesters collect rubbish, setting a civic example.</p> <p>As people scatter, undercover police officers converge on a pair of foreign women at the crowd’s edge, quietly moving them aside for questioning.</p> <p>“We don’t allow unaccredited foreign journalists. Moroccans can take photos and go live all they want. Why should foreigners leave Jamaa El Fna [Marrakech’s famous market square] to film what’s wrong here? It damages the country’s image,” they say.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/inside-morocco\" hreflang=\"en\">Inside Morocco</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\">Casablanca, Morocco</div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

Many also wore patches, pendants, and earrings in the Palestinian colours of red, green, and black.</p> <p>Demonstrators rallied for hours in sweltering heat. They chanted for an end to India-Israel ties, they sang songs in solidarity with&nbsp;Palestinians, and narrated the atrocities being inflicted upon them.</p> <p>In Hyderabad, hundreds of activists gathered at Dharna Chowk, a site known for protests and rallies, to express solidarity with Palestinians and call for a boycott of Israeli products.<br /> <br /> At least 240,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been wounded or killed since the genocide began.</p> <p>One of the organisers of the protest,&nbsp;Priyamvada Sharma, from Indian People in Solidarity with Palestine, told Middle East Eye that protesters wanted the Narendra Modi-led government to sever ties with Israel, for Indian companies to divest from Israeli firms, and for all First Information Reports filed at police stations across the country against pro-Palestine activists to be withdrawn.<br /> <br /> Pro-Palestine activists in India have repeatedly faced beatings or arrest for expressing opposition to Israel's genocide in

\"absurd\" that, two years on, the inhumanity of Israel’s operations in Gaza still had to be spelled out.</p> <p>\"I should not have to explain in 2025 why people getting murdered or bombed, or not having menstrual pads, or not being able to give birth, or not being able to survive is a bad thing,\"&nbsp;Saniya Rehmani, 22, who works in climate advocacy, told MEE.<br /> <br /> \"It should just

think it’s our moral obligation to be here and stand for our brothers who are facing the same occupation that we face,\" Hadi told MEE.</p> <h3>Complicity in genocide</h3> <p>The growing protest movement in India comes as more questions are being asked about India's complicity in the genocide.</p> <p>In late September, the Centre for Financial Accountability (CFA), released <a href=\"http://www.cenfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Profit-Genocide_1.pdf\">a </a><a href=\"http://www.cenfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Profit-Genocide_1.pdf\">report</a>&nbsp;concluding that Indian corporations and state-owned enterprises were helping sustain Israel’s war economy in Gaza through investments and partnerships across multiple sectors.&nbsp;</p> <p>The report,&nbsp;<em>Profit and Genocide: Indian Investments in Israel</em>, argued that&nbsp;Indian companies had grown increasingly tied to Israeli defence production, surveillance technology and agricultural projects.</p> <blockquote> <p>'What Hindutva has done to Kashmir<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_P3uE81D4M\"> </a>and what Zionism is doing there, both are cases of occupation.'</p> <p><em>- Himangi, protester</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The group said the business ties were&nbsp;central to Israel’s ongoing military operations in Gaza and its settlement project in the occupied West Bank and the occupied Golan Heights.<br /> <br /> The report came just weeks after India&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/investment-pact-india-moves-bind-economy-israel\">hosted&nbsp;Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich</a> and&nbsp;signed a&nbsp;bilateral investment agreement. The pact is designed to bolster investor confidence and facilitate business transactions between the two states.</p> <p>Protesters said the ties between the far-right ideologies&nbsp;and governments of Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu made perfect sense.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Obviously, the Zionist propaganda and the Hindutva propaganda in India go hand in hand,\" said 21-year-old Himangi, who provided only her first name.</p> <p>\"What <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_P3uE81D4M\">Hindutva has done to Kashmir </a>and what Zionism is doing there, both are cases of occupation.\"</p> <p>Likewise, Rahmani, a 22-year-old protester, said it was obvious that \"fascists support fascists\" and that she believed that the government's stance did not represent the people.</p> <p>\"Leaders don’t make the country, we do. So, we’re here to tell you that this does not matter and you don’t represent me. This government does not represent me,\" Rehmani said</p> <p>\"I will not be okay with my government, especially when we fought for 200 years to be free from colonisation.</p> <p>\"I will not stand for my government being okay with somebody else’s colonisation.\"</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor\"> <div><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/users/mee-correspondent\" hreflang=\"en\">MEE correspondent</a></div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div>New Delhi, India</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
