Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman publicly called out Israel’s genocide in Gaza.</p> <blockquote> <p>'There is disagreement over the partnership with Israel. The biggest fans of the partnership are more in Dubai then Abu Dhabi'</p> <p><em>- Hussein Ibish, Arab Gulf States Institute</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Despite this, Israel had been able to count on its ties to the UAE - its strongest partner in the Arab world. Now, signs of strain are emerging here, too.</p> <p>This week, the UAE <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-11/israeli-firms-barred-from-dubai-air-show-as-regional-furor-grows\">cancelled</a> Israeli participation at the Dubai Airshow set to take place in November.</p> <p>And the week before Israel struck Qatar, the UAE warned that Israel risked a “red line” if it annexed the occupied West Bank.&nbsp;</p> <p>The warning carried weight because the UAE is the bedrock of the Abraham Accords, the 2020 agreements brokered during the first Trump administration<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">, which saw&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/morocco\" target=\"_blank\">Morocco</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/bahrain\" target=\"_blank\">Bahrain,</a></span>&nbsp;and the UAE establish formal relations with Israel.</p> <p>The US framed the Abraham Accords as a historic breakthrough, but advocates of the Palestinian cause viewed it as a betrayal.</p> <p>Analysts say that when it came to the UAE, both sides missed the point.</p> <p>The UAE was established in 1971 as a federation of seven emirates. Unlike Egypt, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/jordan\">Jordan</a> and even Saudi Arabia, it never fought a war with Israel. The UAE is home to ten million residents, but only one million are Emiratis - the rest are expats and foreign labourers.</p> <p>US envoy Tom Barrack - who enjoys close ties to Emirati leaders - gave perhaps the best explanation of the relationship when he said bin Zayed \"ran\" to the Abraham Accords because he had a small country governed by a “monarchy\".</p> <p>Hussein Ibish, a senior scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told MEE that the UAE remained committed to its strategic calculus of the Abraham Accords, including one of its main foundations: deepening economic and technological cooperation. But he said Israel’s destabilising actions are starting to alarm some.</p> <p>“You usually don’t get factions in the UAE. Major foreign policy decisions are made in Abu Dhabi with consultations from Dubai and occasionally Sharjah,” Ibish explained, referencing the three largest and most powerful emirates in descending order.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>“[But] sometimes issues are so fraught that you get factionalism. And there is disagreement over the partnership with Israel. The biggest fans of the partnership with Israel are more in Dubai than Abu Dhabi, and the more sceptics about how much leeway to give Israel are in Sharjah and Ras al-Khaimah,” he said.</p> <p>In the US, the Abraham Accords were billed as uniting the UAE and Israel against Iran. But Israel has weakened Iran in Syria and Lebanon, and the UAE itself has patched up ties with the Islamic Republic.</p> <h3>The annexation litmus test</h3> <p>The main pillars for the UAE’s decision to make its quiet ties with Israel official have not really changed.</p> <p>A decade ago, both were opposed to democratically elected Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt. The UAE and Israel continue to view the Muslim Brotherhood as an enemy. Hamas is an offshoot of the group. And the UAE wants investment and technology more than ever, with the advent of AI.</p> <p>But Firas Maksad, Middle East director at the Eurasia Group, told MEE that the Abraham Accords were never “cost-free” for the UAE and carried risk, the main one being that the Arab and Muslim world would react with fury at the thought of the UAE brushing aside the Palestinians.</p> <blockquote> <p>'The UAE stuck their necks out for Israel after 7 October [2023]'</p> <p><em>- Firas Maksad, Eurasia Group</em></p> </blockquote> <p>“The UAE stuck their necks out for Israel after 7 October [2023],” Maksad told MEE. “They put themselves on the line and were so outspokenly critical of Hamas. They stuck with Israel and have saw nothing for it.”</p> <p>The UAE’s warning about a “red line” over Israel’s annexation of the occupied West Bank caught the eyes of diplomats and analysts.</p> <p>“The very premise of the Abraham Accords, as far as the Emiratis see it, was preventing the annexation of the West Bank,” Maksad said.</p> <p>Indeed, in 2021, the UAE publicly framed its decision to enter the Abraham Accords as a move to preserve the option of a two-state solution. \"The reason it happened, the way it happened, at the time it happened was to prevent annexation,\" The UAE's ambassador to the US, Yousef al-Otaiba,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/uae-ambassador-abraham-accords-were-about-preventing-annexation/\">said</a>.</p> <p>But when push came to shove, the UAE made it clear to everyone that it would not make its ties with Israel conditional on annexation.</p> <p>Just one month before the genocide in Gaza erupted in 2023, following the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, Otaiba said a “de facto” annexation of the occupied West Bank was underway and that the UAE would not stand in the way.</p> <p>“Our deal was based on a certain time period, and that time period is almost done, and so we have no ability to leverage the decisions that are made outside of the period that was what the Abraham Accords was based on,” he said, referring to its ability to stop annexation.</p> <p>“It’s about Gaza now,” Abdulaziz Alghashian, a Saudi researcher and senior nonresident fellow at the Gulf International Forum, told MEE, explaining that the UAE is trying to thread the needle between its desire to maintain ties with Israel and anger over Israel’s onslaught.</p> <p>All eyes will be on the UAE as a litmus test for how far Israel can go. Qatar is now calling for a collective Arab response to Israel’s attack.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UAE did not provide specifics on what the repercussions of Israeli annexation in the occupied West Bank would be.</p> <h3>Separating Gaza and the West Bank&nbsp;</h3> <p>Since 7 October 2023, the UAE has been an outlier of sorts with Arab states.&nbsp;For example, when asked in February about US President Donald Trump’s Gaza \"Riviera plan\" that most interpreted as a call for ethnic cleansing, Otaiba said&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DSZlQ-XSxYYc&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjExePS5pGMAxVTRvEDHb3cKcwQtwJ6BAgMEAI&amp;usg=AOvVaw04iCPUqJELPn2TWF3D9HgN\" target=\"_blank\">on the record</a>&nbsp;that Abu Dhabi saw no \"alternative\" to it.</p> <p>MEE previously<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-lobbying-trump-administration-reject-arab-league-gaza-plan-officials-say\"> revealed</a> that the UAE has been lobbying the US against an Arab League plan for Gaza and was supportive of Israel displacing Palestinians there to <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt\">Egypt</a>. Ties with Cairo became strained over that lobbying, but Abu Dhabi has continued with its crucial investments there, which are critical to cash-strapped Egypt. That dance underscores the complexity of the UAE’s ties with many countries, including how it views Gaza and the occupied West Bank.</p> <p>“There are tacitly two files. One on Gaza and one on the West Bank,” Alghashian said.</p> <blockquote> <p>'There is an Arab consensus and it’s not 100 percent to what the UAE would like'</p> <p><em>- Abdulaziz Alghashian, Gulf International Forum</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The UAE has long viewed Hamas as a threat. But it also looked down with distain on its main secular rival, Fatah, in the occupied West Bank. The UAE’s preferred Palestinian ally is Mohammad Dahlan, diplomats and analysts say, an exiled Fatah leader from Gaza who has become an emissary for Abu Dhabi in other hotspots.</p> <p>Although ties are stressed, few analysts expect the UAE to radically break with Israel, or signal displeasure by forcefully backing the Arab League plan for post-war Gaza. The plan calls for the Palestinian Authority to take over the enclave and leaves some room for Hamas as a political actor.</p> <p>“There is an Arab consensus, and it’s not 100 percent to what the UAE would like. They will not go against it, but they are preparing themselves to be the disruptor of the Arab consensus. That is the main utility of the UAE for the US and Israel,” Algashian said.</p> <p>In other areas like the Horn of Africa, the UAE remains aligned with Israel. For example, reports say that the UAE has been pressing Somaliland to accept forcibly displaced Palestinians in exchange for US recognition. The breakaway republic is an ally of the UAE.</p> <p>“There might be even more disagreement [in the UAE] over the Horn of Africa than over Israel. No one in the UAE establishment is dead-set against the Abraham Accords as a strategic matter,” Ibish said.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/inside-uae\" hreflang=\"en\">Inside UAE</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

However, because Israel has implemented new screening procedures - resulting in the deliberate and unnecessary slowdown of the flow of food into Gaza - WFP has only been able to screen 20-30 food containers per day.</p> <p>While the report detailed the obstacles that aid organisations have faced at crossings directly into Gaza, it also shared the challenges they have faced coming in from Jordan, which have been documented less.</p> <p>The senators found that unnecessary screening and red tape meant that less than one-tenth of humanitarian aid entering Gaza via the Jordan Corridor was able to make it through.</p> <p>This is despite the fact that the US had provided 280 trucks and helped build 10 warehouses to triple the capacity for humanitarian aid along the Jordan Corridor, enabling 150 trucks per day of aid.</p> <p>They also shared how the US had spent about $1.5 m to purchase advanced screening machines, following a request by the Israeli government, but since the ceasefire ended in March, “Israel no longer accepts trucks screened at the US facility”.</p> <p>According to the report, in the past month, almost half (42 percent) of the trucks in each convoy - typically 60-85 trucks, three times a week - were forced to turn back for one reason or another. This rejection rate was for a much smaller number of trucks (180-255 per week) travelling along the Jordan Corridor, compared to its peak (600-900 per week).</p> <p>In addition, each truck was subject to a new $400 customs processing fee. If they did not pass through the screening process, they had to pay the $400 fee again to have the truck join a later convoy.</p> <p>The senators said that Jordanian officials told them convoys were coming under increasingly frequent attacks by violent settlers and protesters in recent weeks, who slashed tires and “inserted substances into the diesel tanks to render the trucks inoperable”.</p> <p>Overall, the senators concluded that “the world has a moral and legal obligation to stop the ongoing ethnic cleansing… Strong words alone will not be sufficient. The world must impose penalties and costs on those who are implementing this plan”.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/us-politics\" hreflang=\"en\">US Politics</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
