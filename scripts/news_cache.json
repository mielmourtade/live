What’s the difference, and why is it significant?</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Muhammad Shehada:</strong> The significance is that disarmament means surrender, bending the knee, breaking the sword.&nbsp;</p> <p>As for decommissioning, the closest example is Northern Ireland, where it was gradual. It was part of a political process or milestones.&nbsp;</p> <p>It goes hand-in-hand with Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a pathway towards Palestinian statehood or self-determination.

That's the difference.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the realistic scenario is what we have seen in recent days, with Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, adding last-minute details to the text. That includes details about the destruction of, and not allowing the rebuilding of, not just offensive weaponry like rockets and tunnels, but of all weapons.</p> <p>That includes Kalashnikovs or RPGs or things considered more defensive that can be only used inside Gaza against the Israeli military.&nbsp;</p> <p>He's trying to use the words disarmament and demilitarisation, in addition to decommissioning.

In the UK, because of all this, he’s known as a “wanker”.</p> <p>In the context of Palestine, Blair was chairing the Quartet a few years ago tasked with mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and he held many talks with Hamas. This is unusual. He was one of very few western high-level politicians that held direct talks with Hamas leaders, and he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/14/tony-blair-hamas-gaza-boycott-wrong\">went on record and said</a> that “we were wrong to boycott Hamas when they won government elections in 2006”. So that could be a sign of hope.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the other side, you have the new liberal Blair who's raising hundreds of millions from people like Larry Ellison, the billionaire from tech firm Oracle that's supposed to buy TikTok. You have all these shady connections, the intermingling between the Tony Blair Institute, Jared Kushner, Trump's world and Netanyahu.&nbsp;</p> <p>All that doesn’t bode very well for what's going to come next if Blair is appointed governor of Gaza.&nbsp;</p> <p>It sounds extremely weird to even just say the words “Blair as governor of Gaza”, akin to a viceroy. It all sounds very colonial, like something from the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo.&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>MEE: The plan explicitly states that “no one will be forced to leave Gaza”. It says those who wish to leave can do so, and will be free to return. Can the people of Gaza trust this commitment?</strong></em></p> <p><strong>MS: </strong>Even before 7 October 2023, when people were allowed to leave and come back, Israel put all sorts of obstructions, obstacles and traumatic processes in place.</p> <p>It was to ensure that anyone that leaves will never think about going back. Who would want to go back to an unlivable cage, a toxic slum, as Israel has rendered it, and languish and die there? Also the chances of you being able to go out again if you come back into Gaza were virtually close to zero. It was like a very difficult process, you had to pay a lot of bribes. You had to wait for months, sometimes for years.&nbsp;</p> <p>So Israel can play on these bureaucratic procedures and economic aspects to deter people from trying to return.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-deadlock-and-international-pressure-why-netanyahu-backs-trumps-gaza-plan\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/063_2237554274.png.webp?itok=gskfh8Qp\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">War deadlock and international pressure: Why Netanyahu backs Trump’s Gaza plan&nbsp;</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-deadlock-and-international-pressure-why-netanyahu-backs-trumps-gaza-plan\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Can people trust the commitment in the plan? Absolutely not. The plan says that Rafah will be open both ways for people to return and leave. But there are a lot of ways in which Israel can create incentives for people to leave and disincentives for anyone to return.&nbsp;</p> <p>All they need to do is to prevent, undermine, hinder, obstruct the reconstruction of Gaza.&nbsp;</p> <p>Or they would create something like the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-proposal-permanently-end-war-abandons-gaza-riviera-plan-report\">Trump Riviera plan</a> in Gaza that would make everything entirely unaffordable for the entire population. It would end up pricing people out of Gaza itself.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Trump plan talks about redesigning Gaza to look something like Sharm el-Sheikh, Dubai, Doha or one of these luxurious Arab capitals that look like a concrete jungle.&nbsp;</p> <p>That's a nightmare for people in Gaza. It's not an aspiration. People there admire the originality and simplicity of how Gaza used to look like. The mosaic of different cultures, the accumulation of different civilisations on top of each other.&nbsp;</p> <p>We wanted to go back to that - minus the Israeli occupation, apartheid and concentration camps.&nbsp;</p> <p>So it’s a no thank you to making Gaza look like Dubai where it's completely unaffordable.&nbsp;</p> <p>People might be given verbal guarantees of coming back if they leave, but there are many ways in which Israel can render that option impossible for the population.</p> <p><em><strong>MEE: The plan says Israel “will not occupy or annex Gaza”. While it speaks of a phased withdrawal, there is no timetable, and it is predicated on an undefined commitment of Gaza “no longer posing a threat”. Could that leave room for a longer-term, or even permanent, Israeli occupation?</strong></em></p> <p><strong>MS: </strong>The vagueness of the plan about the occupation of Gaza is on brand for Israel's track record over the last three to four decades, at least.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the Oslo Accords, the whole premise was that Palestinians needed to collaborate with Israeli security agencies to police Israel's occupation.&nbsp;</p> <p>It made the occupation cost-free, protecting Israeli settlers from Palestinians, but not protecting any Palestinians from settlers. That was one end of the bargain.&nbsp;</p> <p>The other end was supposed to be that once Palestinians proved a sufficient level of ability to ensure Israel's security, they would be given a state. But Israel kept moving the goalposts.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every year you would have Israelis saying, “the Palestinian security forces are doing a good job, they're improving, but they're still falling short of the necessary level to have their own state or their own autonomous region”.&nbsp;</p> <p>You had a similar thing with the disengagement from Gaza in 2005. Israel explicitly said that they were withdrawing to freeze the peace process and to kill Palestinian statehood by putting the burden of proof on Palestinians.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/key-middle-eastern-leaders-shocked-israeli-rewrite-gaza-plan-still-back-it\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/meeting%20trump%20un%20sidelines%20saudi%20egypt%20afp.jpg.webp?itok=tXwT66O-\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Key Middle Eastern leaders shocked by Israeli rewrite of Gaza plan but still back it</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/key-middle-eastern-leaders-shocked-israeli-rewrite-gaza-plan-still-back-it\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>They called on Palestinians to turn Gaza into Singapore, and to make it secure and not a source of any threat whatsoever towards Israel.&nbsp;</p> <p>The game was rigged from the get go. Gaza’s economy was destroyed and its entire labour force was cut from the Israeli or West Bank markets.&nbsp;</p> <p>All of which designed an environment in Gaza that was inherently destabilising, so that Israel can keep pointing a finger and say: “Look, we're not ending the occupation because Gaza never proved the ability to become a Singapore or to ensure our safety”.&nbsp;</p> <p>In that sense, you see the exact same trick being applied again. Allowing a permanent Israeli occupation in Gaza with some vague terminology about Israel staying in Gaza for as long as Gaza holds even a prospect of the re-emergence of a threat towards Israel.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's a word salad. It doesn't mean anything.&nbsp;</p> <p>Israel can easily point at a single militant in Gaza and say that one single militant holds a threat of recreating an armed group. They can play all sorts of tricks to stay there permanently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>MEE: The plan envisions no resurgence of any kind of “terror” threat from any group or faction. Under the conditions set out, will resistance cease to exist in Gaza?</strong></em></p> <p><strong>MS: </strong>The only condition under which the resistance in Gaza will cease to exist is if you dismantle the apartheid system that Israel maintains.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is very natural that people will always try to resist oppression, dispossession, displacement and replacement.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Europe and the western world, there's rich literature about how income inequality alone increases crime and violence rates in European and western capitals. In our case, it's not just income inequality.&nbsp;</p> <p>You also have the dispossession of your income, the dispossession of your home, the dispossession of your assets. You have displacement, and replacement by Israeli settlers. All of this on its own is radicalising enough. All of it will eventually provoke resistance.&nbsp;</p> <p>To which Israel will escalate the use of violence in this eternal cycle of attrition.<br /> <br /> It's not even a catch-22 because the whole goal is that Israel wants Palestinians to remain stuck in this cycle of Israeli colonial violence, Palestinian retaliation and then Israel crushing Palestinians.&nbsp;</p> <p>With each time the cycle is repeated, you see more and more Palestinians depleted, leaving, collapsing, dying or abandoning the cause. And that's exactly the logic of the Israelis.&nbsp;</p> <p>That's exactly why the genocide is merely the culmination of 78 years of Israeli dispossession, displacement and replacement.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's because previous rounds were not doing it fast enough. Israel now just wants to get it done as fast as possible.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

There is no timetable for such a withdrawal.</p> <p>But there is every guarantee that this postwar plan will stifle at birth Gaza reemerging under a Palestinian leadership of any kind.&nbsp;</p> <p>Under this plan, there is no role for any Palestinian leadership in the rebuilding of Gaza. Gaza is definitively split from the Occupied West Bank by this agreement and all thoughts of joining the two have been jettisoned.&nbsp;</p> <p>The PA fares no better than Hamas or the other factions. Already disarmed, the PA has to go further.&nbsp;</p> <p>According to Netanyahu’s remarks at the<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/29/world/trump-netanyahu-israel-gaza\"> joint press conference</a>, the PA has to drop <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/palestine\">its cases</a> against Israel at the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), it has to stop paying the families of slain fighters, change the school curriculum and tame the media. And only then Israel will see.&nbsp;</p> <p>None of the eight leaders, prime ministers or foreign ministers of <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey\">Turkey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/qatar\">Qatar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/saudi-arabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uae\">the UAE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/jordan\">Jordan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt\">Egypt</a>, Indonesia and Pakistan consulted the Palestinians before agreeing to this plan.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just as the Palestinians have no agency in the authority that is about to be imposed on them in Gaza, they have had no say in devising a postwar plan.</p> <p>The nations are now tasked with forcing Hamas to accept terms of surrender that Israeli tanks, drones, and robots were unable to achieve on the&nbsp; battlefield. They can do this with nothing less than an overwhelming sense of shame.</p> <h3>Arab counter plan</h3> <p>Where was the Arab counter plan? It does not exist. Where was the determination to counter Israel’s expanding borders? That, too, is pure make believe.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/how-trumps-gaza-peace-plan-diverges-previous-agreements\">Differences</a> between the draft and the final statement cover the time limit for handing over the hostages, the distribution of aid, the number of Palestinian prisoners that would be released, the international stabilisation force, and the lines to which Israeli forces would withdraw.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>Where was the Arab counter plan? It does not exist. Where was the determination to counter Israel’s expanding borders? That, too, is pure make believe</p> </blockquote> <p>On each of these issues, Israel’s control has been hardened, and its commitments lessened, between the draft agreed at the UN and the announcement in the White House.</p> <p>But the key ones are the following: a commitment on Israel to allow 600 trucks of aid in a day has been replaced by the words \"full support\"&nbsp;without numbers or specifying what equipment Israel will allow in; a commitment to withdraw from all of Gaza has morphed magically into a withdrawal \"conditional on disarmament and the maintenance of a security perimeter\".</p> <p>The statement <a href=\"https://mofa.gov.qa/en/latest-articles/statements/joint-statement-by-the-foreign-ministers-of-qatar--jordan--uae--indonesia--pakistan--t%C3%BCrkiye--saudi-arabia--and-egypt-welcome-us-president-s-sincere-efforts-to-end-the-war-in-gaza\">issued</a> jointly by the leaders and foreign minister of the countries that Trump met - Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Egypt and Indonesia - referred to the first draft Trump and Witkoff had agreed to in New York.</p> <p>Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/can-jared-kushners-investment-firm-connect-gulf-money-and-trump-gaza-plan\"> Jared Kushner</a> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4r1xjy90ko\">took that plan</a> to Netanyahu.

Another example, the talks with <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iran\">the Iranian</a> delegation that Witkoff was about to have in <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/oman\">Oman</a> when Israeli warplanes and US B2 bombers <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MiddleEastEye/videos/israels-failure-to-subdue-iran-shows-it-can-no-longer-dictate-the-regional-order/728612969713833/\">struck Iran's nuclear facilities</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>This was a deceit Trump publicly revelled in.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-text align-right\"> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Trump's 20-point plan for 'peace' is a call for Palestinian surrender</div> <div class=\"mee-readmore-author\">Mohamad Elmasry</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/trumps-20-point-plan-peace-call-palestinian-surrender\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>The result? Egypt has apparently <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/egypt-agrees-israeli-control-gaza-border-return-rafah-reopening\">signed up</a> to a permanent Israeli presence in Rafah and along the Philadelphi Corridor which separates Gaza from Sinai. Israel has been adamant about retaining control of both.&nbsp;</p> <p>Qatar is back in the role of mediator, although its future worth has been put in grave doubt by Israel's obvious attempts to write it out of this agreement.</p> <p>Netanyahu's apology was limited as he did not apologise for attacking the Hamas delegation Doha was hosting. On the other hand, Netanyahu has got an agreement which hands him complete control over the withdrawal of his troops from Gaza long after the hostages have been released.</p> <p>The key issues which are critical to Hamas - a complete Israeli withdrawal and cessation of war before the hostages are released and the red line of keeping their weapons - have also suffered critical changes between the first and final drafts.</p> <p>The first draft <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/news/trump-gives-hamas-deadline-respond-gaza-plan\">stated </a>that \"Israeli forces will withdraw to the battle lines as of when the [US special envoy Steve] Witkoff proposal was presented to prepare for hostage release.\" But it did not specify which Witkoff proposal, as there have been<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/how-trumps-gaza-peace-plan-diverges-previous-agreements\"> a number of them</a>.</p> <p>The final statement simply <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-president-donald-j-trumps-plan-end-gaza-conflict-2025-09-30/\">states</a> \"Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed-upon line.\"</p> <p>This, too, appears to refer to a map published which gives Israeli forces control of the majority of Gaza even after the first pull back of troops.</p> <p>As The Times of Israel <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-secures-key-edits-to-trump-plan-to-slow-and-limit-israels-withdrawal-from-gaza/\">notes</a>, point 16 of the original agreement read Israeli forces \"will progressively hand over the Gaza territory that [it] occup[ies].\"</p> <p>To this has now been added the following caveats: \"IDF will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the US”.</p> <p>No wonder Netanyahu had a big smile on his face. And no wonder he <a href=\"https://x.com/ryangrim/status/1972854845678961056?s=12&amp;t=ejzRPoAJrFQDpEoeiib8zA\">told Israeli television viewers</a>: \"Who would have believed this? After all people constantly say, you must accept Hamas’ terms, get everyone out. The IDF should withdraw, Hamas can recover and it can also rehabilitate the strip. No way. That’s not happening.\"</p> <p></p> <p>Netanyahu was then asked if he agreed to a Palestinian state. He replied: \"Absolutely not. It's not written into the agreement, but there is one thing we did say. That we would strongly oppose a Palestinian state. President Trump also said it. He said he understands it.\"</p> <p>Here he is right.&nbsp;</p> <p>The last of the 20 points merely says \"The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.\"</p> <p>Article 19 only gives the vaguest nod to statehood. It recognises self determination and statehood as the&nbsp; \"aspiration\" of the Palestinian people - note not the right - but even that aspiration is contingent on \"redevelopment advances in Gaza and PA reform faithfully carried out\".</p> <p>Who is the arbiter of this process? Israel of course.</p> <p>This did not need the busy hands of Witkoff and Kushner to rewrite. The betrayal of the Palestinian national cause by those Arab and Muslim leaders who claimed to have promoted it for so long had already been completed.</p> <p>For there is not one word in this plan about self determination and the inalienable right of Palestinians to their own state. Trump is deaf to anything but Israeli statehood between the river and the sea. He sees Palestinians as migrant workers.</p> <h3>The betrayal complete</h3> <p>Trump devoted some time in his press conference to describe how he defied regional opinion on the decisions he made in his first term of office to <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-recognises-jerusalem-israels-capital-says-trump\">recognise </a>Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, or <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/golan-heights-why-it-matters\">the annexation </a>of the occupied Golan Heights.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"And you know what? It turned out to be amazing. Everybody thought it was going to lead to the end of the world, right? The end of the world, Ron. That’s what they said. It didn’t lead to anything.”</p> <blockquote> <p>After two years of genocide we have ended up with a proposed settlement which is substantially worse than the situation that existed on October 6</p> </blockquote> <p>That is how he really views Israel’s Arab neighbours. With contempt. His description of the history of Gaza is so distorted, it's hard to know where to begin.</p> <p>According to Trump, in 2005, Ariel Sharon, then prime minister of Israel, withdrew from the prime sea front property of Gaza in search of peace.&nbsp;</p> <p>“And they said, 'All we want to do now is have peace.' Instead of building a better life for the Palestinians, Hamas diverted resources to build over 400 miles of tunnels and terror infrastructure, rocket production facilities and hid their military command post and launch sites in hospitals, schools, and mosques. So if you went after them, you wouldn’t even realize you ended up knocking out a hospital or a school or a mosque.”</p> <p>This is what has lodged in Trump’s head about a period when Hamas won the only election ever to take place under Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s rule; when Fatah with Israel’s help tried and failed to mount a pre-emptive coup, and when a brutal 17-year siege started.</p> <p>Trump justifies the destruction of every hospital, school and mosque in Gaza over the last two years which are war crimes and amount to genocide.</p> <p>But it's even worse than that.</p> <h3>Blair's failure</h3> <p>Tony Blair, the man who in his oration at Sharon’s funeral described the former general whose tanks lit the path for gunmen massacring Palestinians in <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/sabra-and-shatila-massacre-four-decades-israels-carnage-has-moved-gaza\">Sabra and Shatila camps</a> in Lebanon as a \"man of peace\", is back to <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/breakdown-tony-blairs-bizarre-proposal-run-gaza\">haunt Gaza</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>No-one outside Ramallah has played <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hamas-slams-us-plan-to-appoint-tony-blair-in-gaza-denies-receiving-ceasefire-proposal/3701805\">a bigger role</a> than Blair in keeping Hamas out of a national unity government, which for decades was the only path to deconfliction.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2006, the year before he became Middle East envoy, Blair sided with then US President George Bush, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/14/tony-blair-hamas-gaza-boycott-wrong\">rejecting the results of a freely won election</a>, boycotting Hamas and laying the foundation of international support for a permanent siege. The Quartet’s conditions <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23361691\">ensured </a>Hamas’ exclusion.</p> <p>Now he is back as a member of the \"Board of Peace\".&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2010, after his term as envoy had expired, the Israeli revisionist historian <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/users/avi-shlaim\">Avi Shlaim</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/03/gaza-tony-blair-betrayal\">wrote</a> of the former UK premier: \"Blair's failure to stand up for Palestinian independence is precisely what endears him to the Israeli establishment.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>In February of last year, while the Palestinians in Gaza were still mourning their dead, Blair received the Dan David prize from Tel Aviv University as the \"laureate for the present time dimension in the field of leadership\".</p> <p>\"The citation praised him for his \"exceptional intelligence and foresight, and demonstrated moral courage and leadership\". The prize is worth $1m. I may be cynical, but I cannot help viewing this prize as absurd, given Blair's silent complicity in Israel's continuing crimes against the Palestinian people.</p> <p>These words read as true about Blair today.</p> <h3>Palestinians alone</h3> <p>The options for Hamas are bleak.&nbsp;</p> <p>The deal before them is substantially worse than the one <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/full-text-ceasefire-agreement-lebanon-and-israel\">Hezbollah accepted</a>, and even that is being violated on a daily basis by Israel.</p> <p>If Hamas surrenders the hostages, it has no guarantees the war will end and no more levers to ensure the release of Palestinian prisoners. Reject it and the war continues with Trump’s full backing.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/arab-autocrats-israel-gaza-genocide-enabled-how\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Egypt-President-Abdel-Fattah-el-Sisi-Antony-Blinken-Alamein-Egypt-August-2024-AFP%202.jpg.webp?itok=LfK53c__\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">How Arab autocrats enabled Israel's Gaza genocide</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/arab-autocrats-israel-gaza-genocide-enabled-how\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>From Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Egypt, there are no surprises in the way they have folded.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Turkey and Qatar are in this too.

Again, Palestine has no authority to halt the court from issuing its decision.</p> <h3>What will happen at the ICC?</h3> <p>At the ICC, Israel has been facing separate proceedings, related to the war crimes investigation launched in 2021 by its former chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda.&nbsp;</p> <p>The ICC is the world’s only permanent international court with the power to prosecute senior officials for international crimes.</p> <blockquote> <p>'We have no right to forget or forgive'</p> <p><em>- Raji Sourani, ICC and ICJ lawyer</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In November, ICC judges issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his then defence minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, with the central charge of using starvation as a weapon of war.&nbsp;</p> <p>The State of Palestine acceded to the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding treaty, on 2 January 2015. In May 2018, the PA referred the situation to the prosecutor, which prompted Bensouda to formally launch her investigation, albeit three years later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But the PA is not the only ICC member that initiated referrals against Israel. Other states have filed their own <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges\">referrals</a> since November 2023, including South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros, Djibouti, Chile and Mexico, amidst the international outrage at Israel’s genocide in Gaza.&nbsp;</p> <p>Triestino Mariniello, an international lawyer who represents Palestine at the ICC, said the PA has no authority to cease the case.</p> <p>“It’s not in the competence of the PA to drop the ICC case,” he told Middle East Eye.</p> <p>And even if Palestine withdraws from the Rome Statute, the case can still go ahead, he explained.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-sanctions-palestinian-officials-over-icj-and-icc-cases\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Demonstrator-Palestinian-flag-White-House-Washington-June-2024-AFP.jpg.webp?itok=BOCoNAbU\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">US sanctions Palestinian officials over ICJ and ICC cases</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-sanctions-palestinian-officials-over-icj-and-icc-cases\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Raji Sourani, a prominent Palestinian lawyer who represents Palestine at the ICC and ICJ, said that Palestinian human rights advocates like him will not be deterred by Netanyahu’s threats.</p> <p>Sourani’s Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, Gaza’s oldest human rights organisation, was among Palestinian NGOs <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/un-experts-dismayed-us-sanctions-against-palestinian-human-rights\">sanctioned</a> by the Trump administration in July over their cooperation with the <a href=\"http://icc.he\">ICC</a> and ICJ.&nbsp;</p> <p>He told Middle East Eye that his organisation will keep working to seek justice for Palestinian victims of human rights abuses, no matter the cost.</p> <p>“As lawyers representing the victims, our only interest is their right to justice, redress and dignity by holding accountable those who committed these crimes. We have no right to forget or forgive,” he said.</p> <p>“The Palestinian Authority has no authority over us as lawyers or as a human rights organisation to prevent us from carrying out our work independently,”&nbsp;Sourani added.</p> <p>“Those who intimidate, threaten, and sanction judges, lawyers, prosecutors, or human rights organisations defending victims of genocide are choosing the rule of the jungle.

Who will decide when to intervene? What will be the rules of engagement?” a second senior regional official asked. “These questions all need to be discussed.”</p> <p>The second official suggested that further negotiations involving the Arab and Muslim countries, the US, Israel and Palestinian representatives would be necessary before such a force could be viable.</p> <p>The source added that Turkey, Jordan and Egypt sought to have UN Security Council approval for the force to legalise the move in the eyes of the international community, but the US and Israel dropped it from the draft plan.</p> <p>“The Israelis don’t want UN involvement in any matter related to Palestine,” said the official.</p> <p>A Turkish source familiar with Ankara’s position said Turkey is considering deploying troops in Gaza, depending on variables such as the structure and leadership of the force.</p> <p>However, a source familiar with Israeli thinking said Netanyahu would oppose any Turkish participation in such a mission.</p> <p>“Yet Hamas may insist on Turkish involvement,” the source noted.</p> <h3>Targeting Hamas abroad</h3> <p>Other elements of the plan remain troublingly unclear.</p> <p>For example, it is not yet defined how Gaza will be governed under the so‑called technical committee or the “Board of Peace”.</p> <p>Another unresolved issue concerns Hamas members who may choose to leave Gaza under Trump’s plan.</p> <p>Israel has vowed to pursue and kill all Hamas leaders regardless of where they reside.</p> <blockquote> <p>'The Israelis don’t want UN involvement in any matter related to Palestine'</p> <p><em>- Regional official</em></p> </blockquote> <p>A strike on Doha on 9 September failed to kill the Hamas figures it was targeting, but nonetheless rattled Gulf Arab states, which rallied around Qatar.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-egypt-discovers-israeli-attempts-kill-hamas-leaders-its-soil\">MEE revealed</a> subsequently that Egypt had uncovered Israeli attempts to assassinate Hamas leaders on its soil too.</p> <p>If Trump’s plan is accepted by Hamas, some of its members are expected to relocate to Turkey, Egypt, or possibly Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Yet regional sources told MEE that those states have not received assurances that Israel will refrain from staging attacks on Hamas there in the future.</p> <p>Regional states worry that hosting them could expose their own territories to Israeli retaliation.</p> <p>Though they sought assurances under the plan, Israel and the United States were not willing to give them.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor\"> <div><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/users/mee-correspondent\" hreflang=\"en\">MEE correspondent</a></div> <div><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/users/daniel-hilton\" hreflang=\"en\">Daniel Hilton</a></div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div>Egypt</div> <div>London</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\">Ankara</div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

a loss of around 20 compared to previous polls.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>Internal pressure within Israel - not just mounting international criticism - also played a significant role in Netanyahu’s decision to accept the American plan</p> </blockquote> <p>In addition to both international and internal pressure, another pivotal factor contributing to Netanyahu’s strategic impasse was the failed Israeli attack in Qatar earlier this month, in which Israeli forces attempted to assassinate senior Hamas leaders.</p> <p>The botched attack sparked a rare show of unity among Arab and Muslim states, forming a broad coalition that included countries Israel had previously considered potential allies.&nbsp;</p> <p>From Egypt to Qatar, and from the United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia, these governments have begun to speak of Israel as a destabilising force in the region.</p> <p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi expressed unusually strong condemnation during a conference in Doha, referring to Israel as <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/sisi-escalates-rhetoric-against-israel-will-act-gaza-genocide\">“the Israeli enemy”</a>, language not officially used by an Egyptian head of state since the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries.</p> <p>Netanyahu understands that this emerging coalition could pose an economic threat through countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and a military threat through countries like Egypt, which is already reportedly mobilising troops in Sinai.</p> <p>The failed Israeli attack in Doha also led to Qatari pressure on US President Trump to limit Israel's activity in the region.&nbsp;</p> <p>Qatar's influence on Trump personally is great, with his family and his administration doing profitable business in the Gulf state.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Vague plan&nbsp;</h3> <p>Following the publication of the proposed plan, Netanyahu appeared content, even claiming that the agreement would lead to the isolation of Hamas, rather than of Israel.</p> <p>Although the deal has yet to be formally signed, Netanyahu appears to hope that a symbolic Israeli endorsement - however non-committal - will be enough to reduce the intensity of international pressure.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/corporate-occupation-trump-plan-no-guarantee-gaza-hell-end\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/palestine-gaza-displaced-people-vehicles-afp.jpg.webp?itok=doh-ilnd\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">A corporate occupation: Trump's plan is no guarantee the Gaza hell will end</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/corporate-occupation-trump-plan-no-guarantee-gaza-hell-end\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>It is possible that his calculated show of support could indeed ease Israel’s growing diplomatic isolation.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, it remains too early to judge, as much depends on the responses of both Hamas and the broader Arab coalition.<br /> &nbsp;‬‬‬<br /> Yet, Netanyahu’s satisfaction with the plan is, in many ways, understandable.</p> <p>The agreement is ambiguously worded and leaves considerable room for interpretation, with multiple loopholes and vague provisions regarding the future.&nbsp;</p> <p>Crucially, it includes no firm Israeli commitment beyond a limited initial withdrawal following the release of captives by Hamas.</p> <p>There is, in fact, no binding Israeli pledge to end the war altogether.&nbsp;</p> <p>The details surrounding the proposed international force - how it will be formed, what mandate it will hold, and how it will operate - remain unclear and undefined.</p> <h3>Coalition trouble&nbsp;</h3> <p>Despite this, several elements of the agreement are likely to face strong opposition from key figures within Netanyahu’s governing coalition - particularly the far-right ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir.&nbsp;</p> <p>Both have been among Netanyahu’s most vocal and influential partners in the genocide in Gaza, and they are unlikely to accept the agreement as it stands.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> While Smotrich, finance minister, and Ben Gvir, national security minister, do not have the power to block the agreement within the government - as Netanyahu retains a governing majority - they could choose to resign in protest.&nbsp;</p> <p>This could trigger early elections, well ahead of the scheduled date in November 2026.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> For Ben Gvir and Smotrich, point 12 of the White House proposal, which states that “no one will be forced to leave Gaza” represents a complete betrayal of one of their central goals.&nbsp;</p> <p>The forced expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza has become a core objective for the far right, one that Netanyahu and several other ministers have echoed as part of Israel’s broader war aims.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/netanyahu-says-israeli-forces-will-not-be-leaving-gaza-after-peace-plan-backlash\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/netanyahu%20trump%20white%20house%20news%20conference%20reuters.jpg.webp?itok=a82_1k-8\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Netanyahu says Israeli forces will not be leaving Gaza amid domestic backlash</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/netanyahu-says-israeli-forces-will-not-be-leaving-gaza-after-peace-plan-backlash\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Smotrich and Ben Gvir view any compromise on this front as a missed, perhaps historic, opportunity to permanently alter the demographic and political landscape - to depopulate the Gaza Strip and, in their view, “resolve” the conflict with Palestinians on Israel’s terms.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Further provisions in the plan will be equally difficult for them to accept.&nbsp;</p> <p>Netanyahu’s apology to Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, the proposed release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners - including scores serving life sentences - and the deployment of an international force into Gaza, all represent major concessions.&nbsp;</p> <p>For years, Israel has staunchly opposed international military or political involvement in Gaza; reversing that stance will be seen by the far right as a capitulation.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Then there’s point 19 of the agreement - calling for “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” contingent on Palestinian Authority reforms - along with clauses allowing humanitarian aid to be administered through UN agencies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Those could further inflame tensions within the coalition. The far right will reject any language implying a future Palestinian state or legitimising UN involvement.<br /> &nbsp;‬<br /> Nevertheless, Netanyahu appears to have sufficient support within his own Likud party to proceed with the agreement. He can also count on backing from the opposition, whose leaders have publicly endorsed the deal.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Still, Netanyahu may choose to call early elections once the agreement is signed.&nbsp;</p> <p>By doing so, he could attempt to reframe the moment politically - presenting himself not as a prime minister under pressure, but as one who resisted both domestic and international demands while delivering a “historic” blow to Hamas.</p> <p>Yet, regardless of how Netanyahu spins it, Israel’s core war aims remain far from realised.</p> <p>The continued presence of Palestinians in Gaza, the potential deployment of international forces, and the possibility - however remote - of Palestinian statehood all represent significant setbacks for the Israeli government.&nbsp;</p> <p>Above all, they underscore the political and strategic crisis Netanyahu now faces.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/analysis\" hreflang=\"en\">Analysis</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\">Tel Aviv, Israel</div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
