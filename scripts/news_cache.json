Instead, she chose to <a href=\"https://x.com/GiorgiaMeloni/status/1970136912686964928\">reduce</a> them to images of the limited rioting in Milan and denounced the protests as \"worthless and shameful\".<br /> <br /> Her right-wing government quickly moved to frame demonstrators as \"extremists who like to destroy while asking for peace in Gaza\", a response that was hardly surprising given that protesters clearly demanded immediate government action against Israel, including sanctions, suspension of military and commercial agreements related to weapons, recognition of <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/palestine-state\">Palestine</a>, an immediate ceasefire and expanded humanitarian aid through institutional channels.</p> <blockquote> <p>Particularly through the&nbsp;state-controlled defence group Leonardo, Italy is Tel Aviv's third-largest arms supplier</p> </blockquote> <p>While it is true that about 70 percent of the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/arms-trade\">weapons</a> sent to Israel come from the United States - and do not pass through Italian ports - it should still be noted that, particularly through the&nbsp;state-controlled defence group Leonardo, Italy is Tel Aviv's third-largest arms supplier.</p> <p>Despite a declared halt on new licences, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/who-are-israels-main-weapons-suppliers-who-has-halted-exports-2024-05-09/\">exports</a> under previously signed contracts have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-arms-exports-israel-continued-despite-block-minister-says-2024-03-14/\">continued</a>.</p> <p>Riding the wave of growing <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/islamophobia\">Islamophobia</a> and Arabophobia among European right-wing parties,&nbsp;Meloni has sought to gain credibility with the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/trump\">Trump</a> administration and Netanyahu's government, never questioning Rome's support for Israel.</p> <p>Since taking office, Meloni has pushed Islamophobic <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/italy-giorgia-meloni-introduces-her-first-islamophobic-policies\">measures</a>,&nbsp;amplifying conspiracy theories about the \"Islamisation\" of Europe and&nbsp;securitising mosques and community organisations. She has also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/giorgia-meloni-street-protest-crackdown-concerns-growing-repression-italy-security-bill-climate-activists/\">cracked down&nbsp;</a>on pro-Palestine voices.</p> <p>Rome's reaction to <a href=\"https://www.governo.it/en/articolo/president-meloni-s-statement-attacks-against-italian-unifil-headquarters/27105\">Israeli attacks</a> on the Italian contingent stationed with Unifil in southern <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/lebanon\">Lebanon</a> was extremely timid, and Meloni displayed an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd1mIj4PTLs\">astonishing silence</a> and total indifference to US-Israeli threats and unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-sanctions-un-special-rapporteur-francesca-albanese-over-israel-criticism\">sanctions</a> against the UN special rapporteur - and Italian citizen -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/who-francesca-albanese-and-why-us-sanctioning-her\">Francesca Albanese</a>.</p> <p>More recently, Meloni expressed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/melon-italy-will-recognise-palestine-if-captives-freed-hamas-excluded\">opposition</a>&nbsp;to Palestinian statehood&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/palestine-statehood-countries\">recognition</a> and aligned closely with Washington, even as she occasionally <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israeli-strikes-on-gaza-beyond-the-principle-of-proportionality-says-italys-meloni\">criticises</a>&nbsp;Israeli strikes as disproportionate. Under growing pressure at home, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/meloni-tells-un-italy-will-back-some-eu-sanctions-on-israel-war-has-crossed-line/\">she told</a> the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September that Italy will support some EU sanctions on Israel and that the war has \"crossed a line\".</p> <h3>Historic firsts</h3> <p>After months of mounting frustration over the government's refusal to act on <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/famine-gaza\">Gaza</a>, this week's general strike saw the people take matters into their <a href=\"https://x.com/invisiblearabs/status/1970123661303509256\">own hands</a> and lead a mobilisation that broke new ground.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Italian journalist Paola Caridi, who has spent years working and researching in Palestine and authored a well-known book on Hamas, noted that it marked several firsts: the first general strike held without the official participation of the main <a href=\"https://x.com/invisiblearabs/status/1970123661303509256\">trade unions</a>; the first political - rather than contractual, related to workers' rights - strike since the Red Brigades kidnapped former Prime Minister Aldo Moro in 1978; and the first general strike focused on an international issue, with Gaza, for many Italians and Europeans, an existential ethical test.</p> <p>These protests were also likely inspired by a wave of actions about 20 days earlier by dockworkers in Genoa, who joined around 5,000 people to block the port again, this time alongside dockworkers in Livorno.</p> <p class=\"text-align-center\"></p> <p>In late August, after the Global Sumud Flotilla set out for Gaza, Genoa's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/09/06/in-genoa-a-mission-for-gaza-revives-the-city-s-activist-past_6745088_4.html\">dockworkers</a> seized headlines in Italy.</p> <p>On 31 August, Riccardo Rudino, spokesperson and member of the Autonomous Collective of Dockworkers (Calp) at the port of Genoa, issued a <a href=\"https://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2025/09/02/threat-to-block-italian-ports-if-sumud-flotilla-stopped_45b80af4-63a5-4fb5-a516-31d0f40e5de7.html\">blunt warning</a> to Israeli authorities during a large demonstration in support of the flotilla, part of which departed from the northern Italian coast bound for Gaza:</p> <p class=\"Indent1\">\"I want to make it clear to everyone: around mid-September, the Global Sumud Flotilla's boats will arrive near the coast of Gaza. If we lose contact with our comrades, even for just twenty minutes, we'll block all of Europe. About 13,000 to 14,000 containers leave this region every year, bound for Israel. If something happens, not a single nail will come out of here.\"</p> <p>His words were echoed three days later by <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/italian-dockworkers-warn-they-will-shut-down-europe-if-gaza-sumud-flotilla-attacked\">Jose Nivoi</a>, Rudino's colleague and a Calp union representative. In response to a question from&nbsp;the Italian newspaper La Repubblica about the risk of Israel preventing humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza, Nivoi said: \"The Netanyahu government's threats do not frighten us. [Itamar] Ben Gvir's statements merely demonstrate the sense of total impunity that Israel has enjoyed and enjoys.\"</p> <p>The Israeli minister of national security&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unionesarda.it/en/world/israel-quot-sumud-flotilla-activists-will-be-treated-as-terrorists-detained-for-extended-periods-without-tv-or-radioquot-n7xcjb3b\">had said</a> that flotilla members would be \"treated like terrorists, arrested, and their boats seized\".</p> <h3>Dockworkers' legacy</h3> <p>Genoa's dockworkers, historically known as \"camalli\" - a word derived from the Arabic \"hammal\", meaning porter - are not new to <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/boycott\">boycotting</a> Israel and taking a stand against the genocide it is carrying out in Gaza.</p> <p>In recent years, some of them - particularly USB union members and activists from Calp, a militant group within the federation for Genoa's dockworkers - have promoted or participated in initiatives to hinder the transit of weapons bound for Israel.</p> <hr /> <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/israel-rejects-hamas-truce-offer-thousands-forced-flee-gaza-city\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of Israel's genocide in Gaza</i></b></a></p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <hr /> <p>As early as May 2021, they mobilised to block shipments of missiles and explosives headed for Tel Aviv, and a month later, in the port of Ravenna, dockworkers' unions called a <a href=\"https://www.ilrestodelcarlino.it/ravenna/cronaca/porto-sciopero-armi-israele-f0b7ecb9\">general strike</a> on the day the Asiatic Liberty ship, loaded with armaments and bound for the Israeli port of Ashdod, was scheduled to set sail. Their determination forced the shipowner to cancel the shipment.</p> <p>In November 2023, a month after the start of Israel's war on Gaza, dockworkers in Genoa organised sit-ins and <a href=\"https://contropiano.org/news/politica-news/2023/11/10/genova-porto-bloccato-contro-lattracco-di-una-nave-israeliana-0166217\">blockades</a> in anticipation of the arrival of ships linked to the Israeli company ZIM, in coordination with other European ports.</p> <p>More recently, in June of this year - perhaps the most striking action before August - they joined French dockworkers in <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/news/italian-french-dockers-refuse-unload-israel-linked-ships\">blocking</a> the Contship Era, a vessel chartered by ZIM.</p> <p>In Genoa, no military cargo was loaded after three containers of weapons parts had already been stopped in the French port of Fos-sur-Mer. Finally, on 1 August, shortly before the Global Sumud Flotilla set sail, dockworkers said they <a href=\"https://peoplesdispatch.org/2025/08/04/dockworkers-in-italy-win-against-arms-shipment-to-israel/\">succeeded</a> in preventing the unloading and transfer of three containers of war materiel destined for Israel.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/global-sumud-flotilla-when-states-fail-humanity-sets-sail\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/2025-09-07T180725Z_1223494756_MT1ZUMA00065WBUO_RTRMADP_3_ZUMA-2.jpg.webp?itok=_wIRH2LS\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Global Sumud Flotilla: When states fail, humanity sets sail</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/global-sumud-flotilla-when-states-fail-humanity-sets-sail\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>But it has never just been about Israel.</p> <p>The history of Genoese dockworkers, especially those of Calp, is one of solidarity with resistance movements and opposition to wars of aggression. In September 1973, just days after the coup that overthrew the government of Salvador Allende, a <a href=\"https://www.liguria.cgil.it/genova/notizie-cgil-genova/11-settembre-1973-il-ricordo-del-cile-ai-luzzati/\">demonstration</a> in solidarity with the Chilean resistance was held in Genoa. Similar actions were organised against the <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/features/port-protest-how-genoa-dockworkers-stand-palestine\">Vietnam War</a>.</p> <p>This tradition continued in 2019 when Calp dockers boycotted the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/saudi-arabia\">Saudi</a> vessel Bahri Yanbu, suspected of carrying weapons for the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/yemen-war\">war in Yemen</a>. The workers <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2019/06/italian-dockers-boycott-saudi-weapons-strike\">refused</a> to load what they called the \"ships of death\", demanding an inspection of the cargo manifest.</p> <p>The dockers' actions are both concrete and symbolic. From a decolonial perspective, they are challenging the normality of commercial routes that enable occupation and siege, while restoring to ordinary workers and civil society a sense of agency denied by politics.</p> <p>The courage and principled resistance of Italy's dockworkers is being recognised around the world. With a legacy of risking their livelihoods to oppose war, their actions have only underscored the cowardice and moral bankruptcy of Meloni's government.</p> <p>The ethical inspiration of protests across Italy's major cities has further exposed the deep gulf separating popular demands for justice from those in power.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Dockworkers have unequivocally promised to \"block Europe\" from a logistical standpoint. Yet from a political and moral standpoint, Europe has already been frozen for far too long, paralysed by its own impotence and complicity in the face of colonial violence and genocide.</p> <p><em>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</em></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/boycott\" hreflang=\"en\">Boycott</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

Blair's handling of the Iraq war had made him deeply unpopular at home and abroad, while the Palestinians saw him as too close to the US and Israel.</p> <p>\"Israelis like Mr Blair because they believe he is on their side and Palestinians in the main do not trust him for the same reason,\" <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6244358.stm\">said </a>BBC Middle East correspondent Jeremy Bowen, on the day of the announcement.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>However, Blair had also been lauded in the past for his role in bringing about the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland in 1998 and his appointment was welcomed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.</p> <p>His period in the role would see widespread upheaval in the region, including the Arab Spring, war in Syria, the rise of the Islamic State group and multiple Israeli assaults on the Gaza Strip, which had been placed under siege in 2007.</p> <p>It also saw the ultimate collapse of the so-called Israel-Palestine peace process in 2014, by which point Blair had been largely sidelined from any involvement.</p> <p>He was accused of being absent in the job, with Chris Doyle of the Council for Arab-British Understanding (Caabu) saying at the time of his resignation that Blair had made “what should be a full-time role, a part-time one”.</p> <p>Others accused him of a conflict of interest, citing his close ties to and big payouts from autocratic rulers and large corporations.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>“What came as a shock wasn’t him leaving, it was that he was still in office.

At the time Hamas was preparing to publish a declaration of principles which revised its 1988 charter to establish a Palestinian state within 1967 borders. Blair&nbsp;offered&nbsp;to take the draft document to Washington. Meshaal refused the offer.</p> <p>Blair met Hamas leaders at least seven times with talks often going on late into the night, MEE revealed.</p> <p>The Guardian reported that Blair had also held talks with Ismail Haniyeh, Meshaal’s successor as head of Hamas’s political bureau, who was killed in Tehran by Israel in July 2024.</p> <p>“In retrospect I think we should have, right at the very beginning, tried to pull [Hamas] into a dialogue and shifted their positions. I think that’s where I would be in retrospect,\" Blair said in 2017.</p> <p>“But obviously it was very difficult, the Israelis were very opposed to it.

It represents the largest maritime aid mission bound for the territory since Israel launched its onslaught against the enclave in October 2023.</p> <p>Dispatching aid by sea to Gaza from Egypt may seem counterintuitive, as Egypt is the only Arab country that shares a land border and has crossings with the Gaza Strip. Egyptian authorities, however, blame Israel for the blockade, insisting that Israel maintains de facto control over the movement of individuals and aid to and from Gaza.</p> <p>More than 1,200 people have registered to participate in the flotilla via an online form, including 29 marine assistants, 24 captains, 150 journalists, 152 medics, 300 doctors and 54 lawyers.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">Last week, the campaign <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=122103568551011217&amp;id=61580336524268&amp;rdid=Q2Glgv3Ybut5RamM\">said</a> that a boat called Ibiza would be the first to set sail from Suez, one of five vessels originally planned to join the mission.

Though mostly symbolic, the organisers stress the mission also carries political weight: it signals that while diplomatic efforts stall, ordinary Egyptians can turn public solidarity into action.</p> <h3>'Valuable bid'</h3> <p>Former presidential hopeful and prominent opposition figure<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/egypt-sisi-presidential-challenger-ahmed-tantawy-sentenced-prison-barred-elections\"> Ahmed Tantawy</a> described it as “a valuable bid to be added to national initiatives supporting the Palestinian cause\".</p> <p>Tantawy, who has joined forces with the initiative, urged political parties - whether supportive of the authorities or in opposition - to treat it as “a cause that transcends divides”.</p> <p>“It is an attempt to stand up against the ongoing ordeal of the Palestinians of Gaza, which has been unfolding for two years and aims to liquidate the cause,” he told MEE.</p> <blockquote> <p>'It's an attempt to stand up against the ongoing ordeal of the Palestinians of Gaza, which has been unfolding for two years and aims to liquidate the cause'</p> <p><em>- Ahmed Tantawy, Egyptian politician</em></p> </blockquote> <p>To date, about 4 tonnes of in-kind aid have been donated. Volunteers are currently sorting and packaging the assistance. If a sea voyage proves impossible, the plan is to hand the supplies to the Egyptian Red Crescent in Arish or Ismailia cities for onward delivery to Gaza. The group recently announced it no longer has the capacity to receive extra donations.</p> <p>Many contributions have been received from ordinary donors: elderly citizens offering part of their monthly medication quota and women donating food and medicines from their own stocks.</p> <p>Twelve sizeable boats are ready to sail, but all await final licensing. Although the organisers initially rejected monetary donations to avoid overdependence on cash, they are reconsidering that stance to allow the purchase of additional vessels if required.</p> <p>Despite being an explicitly volunteer-driven campaign, the Egyptian flotilla has drawn considerable media attention.</p> <p>Over 150 journalists have signed up to join or cover their endeavour. Nonetheless, the Egyptian Journalists Syndicate has remained publicly silent, neither endorsing nor condemning the initiative, a stance Mahmoud finds surprising given that some members are already involved in preparations.</p> <p>The initiative has also formally addressed Al-Azhar Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb and Pope Tawadros II. Neither of the two figures had responded to the appeals of the activists by the time of publication</p> <h3>Official silence</h3> <p>The Global Sumud Flotilla is a civil society coalition bringing together activists, medical professionals, lawyers, seafarers, artists and journalists under a shared nonviolent goal: to challenge the maritime blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid beyond restrictive land crossings. Organisers present it as a coordinated civilian initiative rather than a state project.</p> <p>The campaign unites previous efforts, including the Maghreb Sumud Flotilla in North Africa, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, the Global Movement to Gaza, and Sumud Nusantara in Southeast Asia, under one umbrella. Its aim is to establish a maritime corridor into Gaza by bypassing overland routes, which organisers argue are often delayed, blocked, or tightly controlled by Israeli and allied security protocols.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/spain-follows-italy-sending-navy-aid-gaza-flotilla\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/GAZA_FLOTILLA_AFP.jpg.webp?itok=y9SSypun\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Spain follows Italy in sending navy ship to aid Gaza flotilla</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/spain-follows-italy-sending-navy-aid-gaza-flotilla\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>In Egypt, however, state bodies appear wary. The government has not issued any formal stance regarding the flotilla, further complicating efforts to secure clearance.</p> <p>The obstacles confronting the Egyptian flotilla are considerable. Beyond bureaucratic inaction, organisers worry that Israeli interference could prevent the voyage altogether. The global flotilla has already faced delays due to security incidents and harassment in international waters. The Egyptian group anticipates possible last-minute refusals or intensified scrutiny.</p> <p>If the flotilla fails to set sail, many activists see the fallback option of delivering aid overland through the Egyptian Red Crescent as a less powerful gesture - not for lack of humanitarian value, but because it does not carry the symbolic disruption the sea voyage represents.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Egyptian Sumud Flotilla has drawn praise from some corners of political life.</p> <p>“Future generations will judge nations by whether they acted to defend fair causes, especially when faced with oppression and injustice,” Tantawy said.</p> <p>“The Palestinian cause must not become hostage to internal political rivalries, and that parties claiming to represent the people must back their words with solidarity in practice.”</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/inside-egypt\" hreflang=\"en\">Inside Egypt</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\">Cairo</div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

Out of that sympathy came the<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Exodus-1947-Ship-Launched-Nation/dp/1402752288\"> UN partition resolution of 1947</a>, and with it <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/nakba-palestine-catastrophe-explained\">the catastrophe of 1948</a>.</p> <p>Today Israel, through its genocide and ethnic cleansing, its arrogance and contempt for the Sumud Flotilla as it seeks to break <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iWPZeAiZvQ\">Gaza’s siege</a>, is creating a mirror image.</p> <p>It is generating a fiercer sympathy, this time not for the coloniser but for the colonised. It is producing solidarity so vast, so global, that it seeks to correct the injustice of 1947 and 1948.</p> <p>If Exodus 1947 paved the way for Israel, Exodus 2025 represents the world rising to undo the wrong and restore justice to Palestine after more than a century of dispossession.</p> <p>The world had already spoken. In every tongue, in every capital, voices demanded an end to the genocide. Even the United Nations, so often paralysed by divisions, expressed the will of nations in near-unison.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Yet, Israel shut its eyes to every plea, while Washington wielded the veto to smother resolutions or gutted them before they ever reached the Security Council.</p> <p>It was in this void, this moral vacuum, that the conscience of humanity moved.</p> <h3>The banner of humanity</h3> <p>The first boats <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-bound-flotilla-israeli-seizes-madleen-ship-detains-activist\">were seized by Israel</a> in Gaza’s waters and their passengers forced back home. But the attempt was reborn - larger, louder, defiant: dozens of vessels, hundreds of activists, the world itself sailing to Gaza.</p> <p>Even before they began, Israeli drones <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/flotilla-gaza-struck-drone-tunisian-port\">struck twice</a> in Tunisia’s port of Sidi Bou Said, violating its sovereignty, exposing - yet again-&nbsp; the impunity with which Tel Aviv tramples borders.</p> <blockquote> <p>And so it was not governments but peoples who acted. Not presidents or parliaments, but free men and women who carried the banner of humanity</p> </blockquote> <p>President Kais Saied’s regime at first <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tunisia-denounces-gaza-flotilla-strike-premeditated-aggression\">muttered</a> about an overheated cable before later <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tunisia-denounces-gaza-flotilla-strike-premeditated-aggression\">admitting</a> it was deliberate, though too timid to name the attacker.</p> <p>The rulers of the world stood by - some paralysed, some complicit, most with blood on their hands. Arab leaders busied themselves with <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/doha-summit-arab-and-muslim-leaders-talk-tough-take-no-concrete-steps-against-israeli\">fortifying their thrones</a>, preferring <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a> guarantees to Arab dignity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt\">Egypt</a>, the neighbour that holds Gaza’s last breath in its hands, revealed itself most shamelessly: refusing to allow the flotilla to dock in its ports, <a href=\"https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/09/14/news/u/egyptian-sumud-flotilla-sailing-through-politics-and-security-pressures/\">forbidding its citizens from joining</a>, closing its borders tight as famine and death consumed an entire people next door.</p> <p>Europe, too, showed its duplicity: Spain, Ireland, and Belgium spoke with rare moral clarity, while London, Paris, and Berlin kept the weapons flowing and the cover steady. In Brussels, <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/09/23/can-the-eu-overcome-divergence-over-sanctions-against-israel\">sanctions were blocked</a>, the killers indulged.</p> <p>And so it was not governments but peoples who acted. Not presidents or parliaments, but free men and women who carried the banner of humanity.</p> <p></p> <p>In Italy, mass protests and strikes forced Giorgia Meloni’s far-right government to dispatch a warship - not only in its own waters but beyond - to shield the Sumud Flotilla. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez went further, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/spains-pm-says-he-will-send-warship-protect-gaza-aid-flotilla-2025-09-24/\">promising</a> a naval escort to guard it on its journey.</p> <p>In these moments, the balance of strength inverted: the powerful appeared brittle, quaking before unarmed civilians at sea, while the weak bore the greater power of moral clarity.</p> <p>This is what terrifies Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> <h3>The tide is turning</h3> <p>For two years, Israel has waged open genocide: bombing homes, slaughtering families, dismantling every means of life, starving a people into submission. Alongside this carnage it has spun its lies - that it does not kill civilians, that it does not starve Gaza.</p> <p>But the Sumud Flotilla punctures the facade. It carries journalists live-streaming from the waves, actors, athletes, and artists who cannot be smeared as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gxV8S8_kQQg\">\"terrorists\"</a>. It carries a mirror, and Israel fears nothing more than its own reflection.</p> <blockquote> <p>Not one boat has broken through in years. And yet not one attempt has been silenced. Solidarity cannot be sunk, and conscience can't be blockaded</p> </blockquote> <p>The Sumud Flotilla is not an isolated event but the crest of a long wave. In 2008, two boats reached Gaza. In 2010, Israeli commandos stormed the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/01/mavi-marmara-raid-israel-palestinians\"> Mavi Marmara</a> in international waters, shooting ten activists dead.</p> <p>In 2011, most of Freedom Flotilla II was blocked from leaving Greek ports under diplomatic pressure.</p> <p>In 2015 and 2016,<a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20161004-womens-boat-to-gaza-hope-is-lost/\"> the Women’s Boat to Gaza </a>and <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/6/29/gaza-bound-flotilla-vessel-seized-by-israeli-navy\">Freedom Flotilla III</a> were seized. In 2018, the <a href=\"https://www.trtworld.com/article/71e3211e7838\">\"Just Future for Palestine”</a> Flotilla was intercepted.</p> <p>And now, in 2025, Israel has escalated to piracy from the skies: in May, the Conscience was <a href=\"https://freedomflotilla.org/2025/05/03/press-briefing-and-release/\">struck</a> by armed drones; in June, the Madleen was <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/seizure-madleen-latest-decade-Israeli-attacks-aid-flotillas-gaza\">seized</a>; in July, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-thugs-board-gaza-bound-aid-ship-international-waters\">the Handala intercepted</a>; in August, the Global Sumud Flotilla forced back after being <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPBQRM1jZfg/\">attacked by drones</a> in international waters.</p> <p>Not one boat has broken through in years. And yet not one attempt has been silenced. Solidarity cannot be sunk, and conscience cannot be blockaded.</p> <p>The idea of sending the first boat was born in 2006. Nearly two decades later, what began with two small vessels has become a fleet of more than 50.</p> <p>The lesson of these 18 years is clear: the tide of defiance against the Zionist project rises higher with every voyage.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>With the Sumud Flotilla, that tide has crossed a threshold: the global struggle for a free Palestine is sailing toward its inevitable, victorious destination.</p> <p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/gaza-extermination\" hreflang=\"en\">Gaza extermination</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

large QR code on his lapel, Netanyahu then heaped praise on US President Donald Trump \"for his bold and decisive action\" in attacking Iran's nuclear strikes this summer.</p> <p>Israel launched its unprecedented attack on the Islamic Republic on 13 June, and repeatedly targeted the country's military and nuclear facilities, as well as assassinated&nbsp;high-profile security, intelligence officials and military commanders, and scientists.&nbsp;</p> <p>In response, Iran fired barrages of missiles towards Haifa, Tel Aviv and other major Israeli cities, striking several sensitive areas.</p> <p>Trump's strikes on Iran's three nuclear facilities - the first such act by any US president - came just over a week after Israel began its assault.</p> <p>Since then, Israel's military censor, as a matter of policy, barred local and international media outlets from publishing the details of the exact locations targeted by Iran.</p> <p></p> <p>Later in his speech, Netanyahu repeated the widely debunked claim that Hamas fighters \"burned babies alive in front of their parents\" during the 7 October attacks. He then claimed that&nbsp;Israel's allies, which have become increasingly critical of the ongoing genocide, were privately thanking him whilst publicly condemning the assault on the enclave.</p> <p>\"You know deep down that Israel, Israel is fighting your fight,\" he said, addressing UN members.</p> <p>\"So I want to tell you a secret behind closed doors, many of the leaders who publicly condemn us, privately thank us.</p> <p>\"They tell me how much they value Israel's superb intelligence services that have prevented, time and again, terrorist attacks in their capitals, time and again, saving countless lives,\" he added.</p> <p>More than 238,000 Palestinians have either been killed, wounded or are missing since Israel launched its genocidal campaign, with recent reports, based on Israeli military intelligence data, indicating that more than 80 percent of those killed in the enclave until May of this year were civilians.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/israel-wages-war-on-whole-region-arabs-finally-turning\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/A%20demonstrator%20holds%20a%20poster%20depicting%20Israel%27s%20Prime%20Minister%20Benjamin%20Netanyahu%20as%20during%20a%20protest%20against%20Israel%27s%20genocide%20in%20Gaza%20in%20Paris%20on%206%20September%2C%202025%20%28Reuters%29.jpg.webp?itok=oxO_zsfx\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">As Israel wages war on the whole region, the Arabs are finally turning</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/israel-wages-war-on-whole-region-arabs-finally-turning\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Almost the entire population has fled their homes at least once, with homes, schools, and hospitals devastated by daily air strikes and tank fire.&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout his speech,&nbsp;Netanyahu compared the 7 October attacks with the 9/11 attacks in the US, as he sought to attack the growing international recognition of a future Palestinian state.</p> <p>\"Giving the Palestinians a state one mile from Jerusalem after October 7 is like giving al-Qaeda a state one mile from New York City after September 11,\" Netanyahu said.</p> <p>Members of the US delegation in attendance, who have been Israel’s staunchest defenders at the world body, could be seen applauding.</p> <p>\"This is sheer madness.
