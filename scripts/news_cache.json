We were in talks with the authorities for over two months.</p> <p>\"They ignored us. Their only goal is destruction, not finding solutions for people. Just look at the force they brought here.\"</p> <p>He said he didn’t believe the state would come at them with such strength. In the past, families whose homes were destroyed would move in with relatives, but with entire neighbourhoods now being razed, community solidarity is no longer enough.</p> <p>\"We’re law abiding, not criminals. They say we’re ‘invaders’ but… my family has been here for 80 years. We won’t move, we’ll pitch tents. Bedouins adapt.\"</p> <h3>No guarantees</h3> <p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-right: 40px; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;\">On Tuesday, a meeting was held between the police and the Bedouin Authority, but the talks ended without any agreements.</p> <p>Village residents said that they were informed that they had less than two hours to demolish the entire neighbourhood.</p> <p>One resident, Ziad, said some villagers refused to demolish their homes the day before because no documents or guarantees were provided in writing.</p> <p>“If they had given us a paper to sign with our lawyers, we would have signed. But to give me two hours to destroy my own house without documents? They’d just use that to say, ‘you did it yourself, and that’s it,’” said Ali.</p> <blockquote> <p>'We’re law-abiding, not criminals. They say we’re ‘invaders,’ but… My family has been here for 80 years'</p> <p><em>- Ziad Omrani, village resident</em></p> </blockquote> <p>“We saw what happened to our neighbours who demolished their own homes, they weren’t given any solutions.”</p> <p>There is no guarantee that all residents whose homes were demolished will be eligible for plots in the new neighbourhood.&nbsp;</p> <p>The new neighborhood is planned to include 1,700 housing units, mostly plots and a few apartment buildings.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eligibility is not automatic: the Bedouin Authority must first recognise residents as eligible, then plots are allocated, and finally building permits are issued. But the last step depends on full infrastructure development, which often fails to materialise.&nbsp;</p> <p>In recently recognised villages, only a small fraction of residents have actually received legal building permits.</p> <h3>'This too is ethnic cleansing'</h3> <p>Around 11am, police and bulldozers began to withdraw from the village. Inspectors put up yellow signs warning that construction on the site is prohibited. When residents approached the demolition area, police rushed back at the youths, threatening and pushing them away - a show of force to remind everyone who was in charge.</p> <p>Amid the ruins stood an educator from Shaqib al-Salam, who teaches children from the demolished neighbourhood. He handed out water to residents.</p> <p>\"They [the children] didn’t know what they were waking up to, it came as a surprise. They are at an age where they are not aware of everything that’s going on,\" the teacher said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"I, as an adult, have never seen images like this. It’s shocking and painful. We have students who now can’t do their homework, have nowhere to put their books, nowhere to shower before school.\"</p> <p>In June, thousands protested in Beersheba against the demolitions and launched a grassroots boycott of local businesses to demonstrate the power of Bedouin communities from surrounding unrecognised villages. Some businesses reported losses.</p> <figure class=\"align-center media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"A Bedouin woman and children watch as Israeli police razes their home in al-Sir village on 17 September 2025 (Oren Zif/MEE)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"A Bedouin woman and children watch as Israeli police razes their home in al-Sir village on 17 September 2025 (Oren Zif/MEE)\" height=\"1237\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/bedouin-woman-watches-israel-police-raze-sir-village-oren-zif-mee-17sep2025.jpg\" width=\"2200\" /> </div> <figcaption>A Bedouin woman and children watch as Israeli police raze their home in al-Sir village on 17 September 2025 (Oren Ziv/MEE)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p>This week, protests and calls for a boycott resumed, with around 1,500 people demonstrating on Thursday in front of the Government Complex.</p> <p>Huda Abu Obaid, executive director of the Negev Coexistence Forum, which advocates for Bedouin rights in southern Israel, said the protests reflect growing public anger.</p> <p>She also noted the close family and community ties between Palestinians <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\">in Gaza</a> and Bedouins in the Negev.</p> <p>\"We don’t always say it openly, but people are also protesting to express their anger at what’s happening in Gaza,\" she said.</p> <p>\"They can’t always say it clearly, but this too is displacement, expulsion and ethnic cleansing.\"</p> <p><em>This article was&nbsp;originally published in Hebrew in Sikha Mekomit.</em></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/occupation\" hreflang=\"en\">Occupation</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\">al-Sir, Israel</div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

which confirmed the illegality of Israel’s continued occupation of the Palestinian territories (including the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem) and the obligations of third states not to legally recognise the situation created by Israel’s occupation.</p> <p>The ICJ ruling, affirmed by the UNGA, declared Israel’s very presence in occupied Palestinian territory a breach of fundamental international legal norms, including the Palestinians’ right to self-determination, the prohibition of racial descrimination and apartheid, as well as the absolute prohibition of annexation through the use of force.</p> <p>The breach of fundamental legal norms triggers immediate legal obligations on Israel and third states to end the occupation and cease any support or recognition for it.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, a year later, Israel has defied the ICJ and UNGA’s recommendations, while most states have not complied with their obligations under international law as stipulated by the resolution.</p> <p>The text in particular called upon third states to take the following steps:</p> <ul> <li style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">Prevent their citizens, companies, and authorities from recognising or assisting Israel’s unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territories.<br /> &nbsp;</li> <li>Halt imports of goods from Israeli settlements and stop arms transfers to Israel

To tackle them properly requires expertise in international relations, along with a deep understanding of 20th-century history, in which many of today’s crises find their origins.</p> <p>Guiding a complex institution like the EU, in a world made ever-more complex amid the Great Power competition and a massive number of asymmetrical challenges, also requires a reasonable amount of vision and commonsense. Unfortunately, Kallas seems to lack all of these characteristics.</p> <p>After the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/china\">China</a>, which was followed by a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/live-blog/china-parade-putin-kim-jong-un-xi-military-live-updates-rcna228503\">military parade</a> in Beijing celebrating the victory over fascism in World War II - attended by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8z83np4xjo\">dozens of dignitaries</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/russia\">Russian</a> President Vladimir Putin - Kallas&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/tparsi/status/1963633840146072017\">said</a> it was news to her that China and Russia were among the countries that defeated Germany and Japan (ie, the forces of Nazism and fascism).</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>If I was the president of the European Commission, I would have fired her straightaway for unfitness to the role. Should I imagine a new job for her, it would be as a library archivist obliged to dedicate at least three hours a day to 20th-century history books, with compulsory monthly exams.</p> <p>Any serious EU journalist should regularly ask their leaders how, under their watch, such a disgraceful choice was made.</p> <h3>Immense suffering</h3> <p>For the record, the Soviet Red Army crushed the German army (Wehrmacht) on the Eastern Front between 1941 and 1945 and liberated Berlin. The Soviet Union - nowadays Russia, a clarification that is necessary amid the remote possibility that Kallas may read this article - suffered more than 20 million casualties. The siege of Leningrad (now St Petersburg) - a city not far from Kallas’s Estonian hometown - alone cost the Soviets more than one million people.&nbsp;</p> <p>While it is true that the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk\">UK</a> were instrumental in the victory of the Second World War in Europe, the country that literally destroyed the German war machine was the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front. It suffices to note how many German armoured divisions were deployed on the Western Front after the US/UK landed in Normandy in 1944, compared with how many were deployed on the Eastern Front between 1941 and 1945.</p> <blockquote> <p>While Russian officials are accustomed to Kallas's misrepresentations of their country, Chinese dignitaries were unable to conceal their shock</p> </blockquote> <p>China endured similar immense suffering during the war, putting its death toll at 20 million. Before and throughout the Pacific War between the US and Japan between 1941 and 1945, China engaged at least one-third of the Imperial Japanese Army. Without China keeping hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers engaged inside its own territory, the US defeat of Japan would have been significantly more complicated and costly.</p> <p>While Russian officials are accustomed to Kallas’s misrepresentations of their country, Chinese dignitaries were unable to conceal their shock at her recent remarks. A foreign ministry spokesperson issued an unusually <a href=\"https://responsiblestatecraft.org/kaja-kallas-history/\">harsh rebuke</a>, saying her comments were “full of ideological bias”. This episode will not help efforts to put relations between the EU and China back on track.</p> <p>What Kallas lacks in historical literacy, however, she makes up for in double standards. Having had no problem in severing all EU ties with Russia, she is now attempting the same with China - while apparently feeling no embarrassment in maintaining close relations with <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\">Israel</a>, which is under scrutiny for <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/meaning-definition-what-genocide-israel-gaza\">genocide</a> at the International Court of Justice, and whose leader has been indicted by the International Criminal Court.</p> <h3>Diplomacy abandoned</h3> <p>If double standards could be monetised, the EU would have enough resources for the green transition, post-Covid recovery plans, and defence spending on par with the astronomical American budget - while still maintaining intact all its social programmes.</p> <p>Under the watch of Kallas and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the EU has become totally irrelevant on the world stage.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/russia-ukraine-war-european-leaders-should-listen-trump\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/ukraine-tank-training-october-2024-genya-savilov-afp.jpg.webp?itok=xy7dqBvl\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Russia-Ukraine war: European leaders need to wake up to Trump's peace plan</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/russia-ukraine-war-european-leaders-should-listen-trump\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>It followed the US and UK down a very dangerous slope on the Ukraine war, by completely forgetting a political tool known as diplomacy and conventional wisdom, which cautions against demonising an adversary with whom, amid hard military realities, one must ultimately reach an understanding - particularly when the alternative is devastating and potentially catastrophic warfare.</p> <p>Then, as often happens, the combative EU leaders were left in the lurch by their increasingly unreliable ally across the Atlantic Ocean, who recently <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c2kzn1nw1d4t\">rolled out the red carpet</a> for Putin.&nbsp;</p> <p>After having endured this humiliation, European leaders inexplicably doubled down by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCFoM715R6A\">accepting a summons</a> to the Oval Office, and sat around President Donald Trump’s desk like turbulent high schoolers whose principal has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-meeting-photos-starmer-macron-meloni-merz-b2810525.html\">gathered them</a> for a reprimand. This is not even to mention the deal Von der Leyen agreed to earlier in the summer with the US president after he played a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93dpl0p200o\">round of golf</a> in Scotland.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it seems this is not over yet.

clear that they were not aligned with US envoy Thomas Barrack on the need to integrate Syrian Kurds with the Damascus government, Middle East Eye understands.&nbsp;</p> <p>One source familiar with the matter said the diplomats were serving at the Syria Regional Platform (SRP), which has overseen Syria policy from Istanbul since the closure of the US embassy in Damascus in 2012.</p> <p>The source added that SRP director Nick Granger, a senior foreign service officer, was among those reassigned.&nbsp;</p> <p><span dir=\"RTL\" lang=\"AR-SA\">“</span>These diplomats were holdovers from former US national security coordinator for the Middle East Brett McGurk,” one source said. <span dir=\"RTL\" lang=\"AR-SA\">“</span>They often found themselves at odds with Barrack over the Syrian Democratic Forces.”&nbsp;</p> <p>McGurk has been a strong supporter of the Kurdish-dominated paramilitary Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) since 2014, when Washington partnered with Syria’s Kurds against the Islamic State group.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \"

the SDF to integrate into Syria’s army, a Middle Eastern official told MEE.</p> <p>The Syria Regional Platform was plagued with infighting as some officials moved closer to Barrack’s position on a

None of the Hamas top brass were killed.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Monday, an emergency summit was held jointly in the Qatari capital by representatives of the 57 member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), as well as the Arab League, to discuss the regional response to Israel’s escalation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Al Habtoor Research Centre concluded that a coordinated airspace blockade in response to Israeli actions would inflict severe damage on Israel across multiple sectors of its economy.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>The report estimated that it would cause Israel’s GDP to contract between 4.8 and 5.7 percent, which would trigger a recession.&nbsp;</p> <p>A wide-scale blockade including OIC members such as <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey\">Turkey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/pakistan\">Pakistan</a> and Indonesia would sever direct flights to Israel’s east and south, creating a significant barrier to high growth markets in Asia and Africa.&nbsp;</p> <p>It estimated that detours which added four to six hours to flights could cost between $30,000 to $60,000 per flight. Israeli airline El-Al would likely suffer a reduction of revenue of between 60 to 75 percent, according to a “conservative estimate”.&nbsp;</p> <p>Such a move, according to the paper, would disrupt tourism to Israel, and high-value time-sensitive exports like diamonds and medical equipment.&nbsp;</p> <p>It would likely cause contract cancellations, as well as a potential exodus of research and development initiatives based in Israel.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/how-will-qatar-gulf-respond-israeli-strike-doha\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/aftermath-doha-israel-attack-september-2025-afp.jpg.webp?itok=XiXu5OR7\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">How will Qatar and the Gulf respond to Israeli strike on Doha?</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/how-will-qatar-gulf-respond-israeli-strike-doha\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Beyond the economic consequences, the paper stated that such a bold move would fundamentally re-order the regional geopolitical landscape.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gulf countries, and in particular Qatar, have long relied on the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a> as a major security and diplomatic partner.&nbsp;</p> <p>Washington’s failure to stop Israel from carrying out an attack in a country hosting over 8,000 American personnel has sparked conversations about a diversification of strategic partnerships.&nbsp;</p> <p>Al Habtoor Research Centre said that an Arab and Islamic air blockade would foster a new region-driven security architecture that would present a diplomatic crisis for the US, which would be forced to choose between its ally Israel or its vital partnerships in the Arab world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, said earlier this week that Israel faces “isolation” on the global stage, and would need to adapt to an economy with “autarkic characteristics”, referring to economic self-sufficiency.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I am a believer in the free market, but we may find ourselves in a situation where our arms industries are blocked.
