Transferring their product - which until 2000 was 70 percent consumed in <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\">Israel</a>&nbsp;- through the myriad security checkpoints requires endless paperwork and inspections.</p> <blockquote> <p>'I think women have more passion when they work in the beer industry'</p> <p><em>Madees Khoury, Taybeh Brewing Company</em></p> </blockquote> <p>A journey that should take a matter of hours can often take days as a result, leading to the brewery missing the deadline at ports for export.</p> <p>These challenges have escalated dramatically in the last two years, however, with the surge of Israeli attacks and the construction of a new illegal settlement near Taybeh, one of a handful of Christian-majority towns in the West Bank.</p> <p>Last year, Khoury <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/06/palestinian-brewery-persists-israeli-curbs-bite-wartime\">said </a>that while Taybeh's beer is exported to 17 countries, the brewery's sales have fallen by about 80 percent because of the Covid-19 pandemic and Israel's genocide in Gaza and crackdown on the West Bank.</p> <p>\"The settler attacks have increased even on our town, Taybeh, which never happened before. But since July, we've been getting multiple attacks,\" Khoury told MEE.</p> <p>\"And every time, it's becoming more and more violent. And it's become very scary to live there and to do business.\"</p> <h3>'It's still getting worse'</h3> <p>Khoury grew up under the Israeli occupation, and her earliest memories include travelling through the myriad checkpoints and security installations Israel has planted throughout the occupied territory.</p> <p>Arbitrary detention, killings and settler violence have always been a fact of life, but the Taybeh brewery managed to punch above its weight, attracting visitors from across the West Bank and the rest of the world, not least for its once annual <a href=\"https://taybehbeer.com/oktoberfest/\">Oktoberfest </a>festival.</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Nadim Khoury, co-founder of Taybeh Brewing Co.

And it's still getting worse,\" said Khoury.</p> <p>On 14 July, settlers <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-settlers-and-military-raid-palestinian-christian-village-occupied-west-bank\">set</a> Taybeh’s historic Church of Saint George alight, along with its adjoining graveyard.</p> <p>That attack was severe enough to prompt<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/mike-huckabee-urges-accountability-church-attack-occupied-west-bank\"> rare condemnation</a> of Israeli settlers by the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a> ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, an otherwise staunchly pro-Israel Christian fundamentalist.</p> <p>Despite this, on 28 July another group of settlers set fire to two cars owned by Palestinian residents and spray painted racist graffiti on walls. Once the settlers left, the Israeli military also raided the village.</p> <p>Khoury said that they were still managing to keep the brewery's production on track. However, in July settlers attacked the spring providing most of Tabyeh’s water, as well one of the main water pipelines.</p> <p>\"The Israeli settlers, they broke the cameras. They broke the system.

Children were found to be particularly targeted.<br /> &nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Preventing births within the group: </strong>The attack on Gaza’s largest fertility clinic destroyed thousands of embryos, sperm samples, and eggs. Experts told the commission this would prevent thousands of Palestinian children from ever being born.</li> </ol> <h3>Genocidal intent</h3> <p>In addition to the genocidal acts, the investigation concluded that the Israeli authorities and security forces have the genocidal intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip</p> <p>Genocidal intent is often the hardest to prove in any genocide case. But the authors of the report have found “fully conclusive evidence” of such intent.&nbsp;</p> <p>They cited statements made by Israeli authorities, including President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and&nbsp;Yoav Gallant - who served as defence minister for much of the war -&nbsp;as direct evidence of genocidal intent.</p> <p>It also found that the three leaders have committed the crime of incitement to genocide, a substantive crime under Article III of the convention, regardless of whether genocide was committed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, on the basis of circumstantial evidence, the commission found that genocidal intent was the “only reasonable inference” that could be drawn based on the pattern of conduct of the Israeli authorities. That is the same standard of proof that will be used by the ICJ in its current proceedings against Israel.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"line-height: 1.38;\">The commission said it identified six patterns of conduct by Israeli forces in Gaza that support an inference of genocidal intent:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Mass killings:</strong> Israeli forces have killed and seriously harmed an unprecedented number of Palestinians since 7 October 2023, mostly civilians, using heavy munitions in densely populated areas. By 15 July 2025, 83 percent&nbsp;of those killed were civilians, the report found. Nearly half were women and children.<br /> &nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Cultural destruction</strong>: The systematic leveling of homes, schools, mosques, churches, and cultural sites was cited as evidence of an effort to erase Palestinian identity.<br /> &nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Deliberate suffering:</strong> Despite three provisional orders from the ICJ and repeated international warnings, Israel continued policies knowing Palestinians were trapped and unable to flee, the commission said.<br /> &nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Collapse of healthcare:</strong> Israeli forces targeted Gaza’s healthcare system, attacking hospitals, killing and abusing medical personnel, and blocking vital supplies and patient evacuations.<br /> &nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Sexual violence:</strong> Investigators documented sexualised torture, rape, and other forms of gender-based violence, describing them as tools of collective punishment.<br /> &nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Targeting children:</strong> Children were shot by snipers and drones, including during evacuations and at shelters, with some killed while carrying white flags.</li> </ol> <p>“Israeli political and military leaders are agents of the State of Israel; therefore, their acts are attributable to the State of Israel,” the report read.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“The State of Israel bears responsibility for the failure to prevent genocide, the&nbsp; commission of genocide and the failure to punish genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.”</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <h3>Who are the UN investigators?</h3> <p>The three-member commission of inquiry was established in May 2021 by the Geneva-based <a href=\"https://undocs.org/A/HRC/RES/S-30/1\">UN Human Rights Council</a> (HRC) with a permanent mandate to investigate international humanitarian and human rights law violations in occupied Palestine and Israel from April 2021.&nbsp;</p> <p>The commission is mandated to report annually to the HRC and the UN General Assembly.

There is no coherent GCC military command structure.</p> <p>During previous attacks on members, such as those by Yemen’s Houthis on Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the GCC did not mount a collective defence effort.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Gulf leaders were already alarmed over Israeli belligerence in Lebanon, Syria and Iran. Their populations are also seething with anger over Israel's genocide in Gaza, where over 64,900 Palestinians have been killed.

Qatar is home to the US’s largest military base in the region, and the building bombed by Israel was located a stone's throw from the US ambassador’s residence in Doha.</p> <p>Analysts <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/what-are-the-limits-of-uae-israel-partnership\">tell</a> MEE that there is some internal dissent within the UAE - Israel’s closest Arab partner - over how to respond to the Israeli attack on Qatar. Haaretz reported last week that Qatar had asked the UAE to close its embassy in Israel.</p> <p>The Doha conference played out while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday.</p> <p>During a joint press conference with Rubio, Netanyahu refused to rule out further attacks on countries with Hamas members. Egypt, Turkey and Qatar are all known to host Hamas officials at various times. Turkey is a Nato member.</p> <p>Rubio did not outright condemn the Israeli attack.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump gave a rambling answer that appeared to imply US involvement in the attack and did not rule out further Israeli strikes.</p> <p>“Qatar has been a great ally to the US. A lot of people don’t know that, and its emir is a wonderful person. I also told Netanyahu that when we attack others, we must be careful,” Trump said.</p> <p>Qatar and Egypt have played a key role in mediating between Hamas and Israel at the US’s request. Following the Israeli attack on Doha, some analysts and diplomats raised the possibility of Qatar ending its mediation efforts.</p> <p>But on Monday, Rubio appeared to brush off mediation as irrelevant, saying Hamas is “a terrorist group, a barbaric group, whose stated mission is the destruction of the Jewish state. So we’re not counting on that [a ceasefire] happening”.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
