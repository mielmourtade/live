They will also lead ‚Äústrategic security diplomacy‚Äù with other actors, ‚Äúincluding Israel, Egypt and the United States‚Äù.&nbsp;</p> <p>The document notes that initially, Gita‚Äôs senior officials won‚Äôt be in Gaza.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the first year, they‚Äôll be based in ‚Äúcoordination cells‚Äù such as El-Arish in Egypt‚Äôs Sinai and ‚Äúremote policy hubs‚Äù such as Cairo and Amman.&nbsp;</p> <p>There would be partial deployment into Gaza by the second year, before ‚Äúfull operatationalisation‚Äù into the enclave in the third year.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Hierarchical structure</h3> <p>An organisational chart at the end of the document lays out the hierarchical structure of Gita, with the board and chairman at the top.&nbsp;</p> <p>A security body, the ‚ÄúInternational Security Force‚Äù, is on the same row as the board and chairman and appears to be outside of the hierarchy.&nbsp;</p> <p>This body will man crossings into Gaza, naval approaches and ‚Äúperimeter zones‚Äù in

underneath the board and the chairman will be a number of bodies and structures - none of which appear to be directly Palestinian-run - including an investment and economic development authority and an ‚Äúexecutive secretariat‚Äù.</p> <p>The latter will coordinate daily operations, including digital creating systems to identify Palestinians in Gaza and ‚Äúdigital platforms for licensing and

Authority (PA).</p> <p>It is below this, at the very bottom of the chart, where we see named Palestinian involvement: the ‚ÄúPalestinian Executive Authority‚Äù.</p> <h3>Palestinian Executive Authority, with little authority</h3> <p>Despite the name, the Palestinian Executive Authority, at the bottom of the hierarchy, has little to no independent authority.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is separate from the PA, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank.</p> <p>It would be made up of technocratic ministries that administer health, education, water supply and energy, labour market policies, housing, local criminal justice and welfare, among a few other policy areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>It would be headed up by a ‚ÄúPalestinian Chief Executive Officer‚Äù, appointed by the international

href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/recognition-palestine-repeat-wests-oslo-peace-fraud\">Read More ¬ª</a> </div> <p>It‚Äôs notable that the language used for all roles throughout the document, like board, chairman and CEO, reflects a business structure rather than a country or territory.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Palestinian CEO will lead the process of identifying ‚Äúdirectors‚Äù (not ministers) to head up the various departments like health, education, infrastructure and planning.&nbsp;</p> <p>The directors will need to ‚Äúmeet standards of technical competence, integrity, and neutrality‚Äù.&nbsp;</p> <p>The international board of billionaires and businesspeople will have the final say on appointments ‚Äúto safeguard institutional legitimacy and independence‚Äù.&nbsp;</p> <p>‚ÄúAll department heads are subject to performance review and can be dismissed or replaced in accordance with transitional governance procedures,‚Äù the document notes.&nbsp;</p> <p>An Israeli source told Haaretz that the Palestinian Executive Authority would be completely subordinate to the board and have no independent authority.&nbsp;</p> <p>As such, it would be far weaker than the technocratic administration set out in a joint Arab plan led by Egypt earlier this year.&nbsp;</p> <p>Below the Palestinian Executive Authority are a number of municipal roles related to the running of local public services and utilities.&nbsp;</p> <p>‚ÄúAll mayors and senior municipal administrators are nominated by the Palestinian Executive Authority and formally appointed by the GITA International Board,‚Äù the plan states.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once again, it is also spelled out that any Palestinian appointees to such roles ‚Äúmust meet strict standards of political neutrality‚Äù.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is not spelled out whether the likes of Aryeh Lightstone, the pro-Israel former adviser named in the document as a potential board member, is considered ‚Äúpolitically neutral‚Äù.</p> <h3>International law</h3> <p>There are various judicial and legal arms to the authority, too.&nbsp;</p> <p>That includes a legislative and legal supervisor who, among other things, would ensure that the transitional authority was operating in a manner ‚Äúconsistent with international law‚Äù.&nbsp;</p> <p>Given how closely this authority states that it will work with Israel, which has been breaching international law in the West Bank and Gaza for over seven decades, it will have its work cut out.&nbsp;</p> <p>There will also be a ‚Äújudicial board‚Äù to oversee due process, legal compliance and justice sector reforms.&nbsp;</p> <p>The board will be ‚Äúchaired by a reputable Arab jurist, preferably Palestinian‚Äù.&nbsp;</p> <p>Interestingly, one of its roles will include legally protecting the ‚Äúright to return‚Äù for any Palestinian in Gaza who decides to voluntarily leave their home.&nbsp;</p> <p>‚ÄúGITA does not facilitate or endorse population relocation but ensures that all voluntary movement is conducted in accordance with international law and rights protections,‚Äù the plan states.&nbsp;</p> <p>Palestinians will likely be sceptical of any such promises, particularly from an authority that will have Israeli backing.&nbsp;</p> <p>During <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/nakba-palestine-catastrophe-explained\">the Nakba</a> in 1948, when 750,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes in what is now Israel, many thought they would be gone for just days. Over 77 years later, they still have not been allowed to return.&nbsp;</p> <p>The draft plan mentions that Gita will work ‚Äúin close consultation‚Äù with the PA, with a view to eventually handing management over to it.&nbsp;</p> <p>It doesn‚Äôt set out a timetable for when this will happen.&nbsp;</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

Time and time again, our calls have been met with evasion, obfuscation and denial.</p> <p>To this day, we still do not know <a href=\"https://www.declassifieduk.org/70-questions-the-uk-government-must-answer-about-gaza/\">what legal advice</a> the government has received on an assessment of genocide, or whether that advice will be made public.</p> <p>No one can pretend they did not know what was happening. Today, some politicians have finally started to backtrack.</p> <p>We have noticed their change in rhetoric, but we will never forget their moral cowardice when it mattered the most.</p> <p>Today, schoolchildren are taught about history‚Äôs worst crimes against humanity. In the future, our history books will shame those who enabled one of the greatest crimes of our time.</p> <p>This government‚Äôs legacy will be its complicity in one of the greatest crimes against humanity of the century.&nbsp;</p> <h3>A real political choice</h3> <p>I need not watch the prime minister‚Äôs speech to know what he will say: <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/uk-starmer-all-guns-no-butter-policy-will-cost-him-dearly\">defence</a>, defence, defence.</p> <p>The government has not been generous to<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPEdghViJot/\"> children in poverty </a>or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/07/disability-cuts-educational-rights-special-needs-children-parents\">the disabled</a>. But there is one area where the government has been very generous indeed. That area is <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/wages-not-weapons-uk-defence-spending-soars-labour-movement-takes-stand\">arms spending</a>: new nuclear weapons, more nuclear-powered submarines, and more F35 planes from the USA.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-text align-right\"> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Recognition of Palestine is a repeat of the West‚Äôs Oslo 'peace' fraud</div> <div class=\"mee-readmore-author\">Jonathan Cook</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/recognition-palestine-repeat-wests-oslo-peace-fraud\">Read More ¬ª</a> </div> <p>The government could have pursued a foreign policy that defends human rights and brings about peace.</p> <p>Instead, as images of starving children circulate around the world, our government has ensured it will be remembered for the human suffering it has refused to alleviate.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is abundantly clear that people are yearning for something different; for a world that cares for each other and cares for all.</p> <p>That is why we have launched a new kind of political party. One that harnesses the collective call for peace. One that believes in the equal value of all human life. One that will always stand with the people of Palestine.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our founding conference will be very different from Labour's. It will vow to stop, rather than deny, the genocide in Gaza. It will empower members to shape the future of our party and our country. And it will kickstart a mass, democratic movement that will finally offer people hope in a more equal, sustainable and peaceful world.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you want to be part of this, you just need to become a member of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://yourparty.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">yourparty.uk</a>. This is how you can take Your Party into your hands. This is how you can help build a real alternative. This is how you can bring something rare back into politics: hope.&nbsp;</p> <p>For too long, people have been denied a real political choice.
