Even if the UK government had had a sizeable role in this, frankly it should be embarrassed at much of what emerged.</p> <p>In the real world, who cares?</p> <p>What to make of <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/steve-witkoff-stepping-back-trump-administration-after-gaza-deal-sources-say\">the \"Board of Peace</a>\"? At first you might imagine it would be a joint committee of Israelis and Palestinian political figures determining some collective future. No, it will be Trump and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/breakdown-tony-blairs-bizarre-proposal-run-gaza\">Tony Blair</a>, that historic Middle East disaster architect.</p> <p>Trump was a sponsor of the genocide in Gaza. As with his predecessor, he ensured<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\"> Israel</a> had all the weapons it needed. How tasteless to address the Knesset and joke that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked for weapons, \"some I’d never heard of\".</p> <p>Those weapons killed thousands of Palestinian civilians, the majority of whom are women and children. Blair has yet to issue any serious criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, an echo of his <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-says-tony-blair-not-welcome-gaza-following-ceasefire\">failed </a>years as the Middle East Quartet envoy.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Things could only get worse.</p> <p>What was this <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/trending/trumps-gaza-ceasefire-summit-turns-viral-spectacle-gaffes-and-awkward-diplomacy\">summit in Sharm El Sheikh</a>? It was more like a Trump majlis, where he invited global figures of his own choosing to come and pay homage, making them wait two hours for the privilege. One by one each was summoned to shake hands with the great peace-maker extraordinaire and to show their fealty.</p> <p>The cast list was bizarre. The <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\">Palestinian </a>President Mahmoud Abbas was a last-minute afterthought to join, when he and Palestinians should have been centre stage.&nbsp;</p> <p>Someone has yet to offer a valid reason as to why <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/tags/hungary\">Viktor Orban</a> was there. Had Hungary had some significant input into this great deal? At least he is a head of government, but equally baffling was what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2025/10/14/why-was-the-president-of-fifa-gianni-infantino-at-the-gaza-summit/\">Gianni Infantino</a>, the head of FIFA,&nbsp;has to do with the future reconstruction and governance of Gaza.</p> <p></p> <p>Every leader dutifully praised Trump, some to embarrassing excess. It is not to say he does not deserve some praise.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump finally put real pressure on Netanyahu to sign up to a deal he had so studiously avoided, and to submit to an international approach to getting a ceasefire. Trump cajoled regional leaders into action as well. All of this President Biden could have done a year ago and more, but did not.&nbsp;</p> <p>But imagine what the Palestinian people made of this fanfare? Many of those leaders had been an active party to the genocide and starvation of Gaza. Others had refused to condemn it.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Absurd hyperbole</h3> <p>Away from fantasy land to the north of Gaza, far from the rebuilding beginning that Trump was boasting about, Palestinians were digging their loved ones out of the rubble.</p> <blockquote> <p>It is not a peace deal nor comprehensive. It is a ceasefire proposal with certain points about future stages</p> </blockquote> <p>Hundreds of thousands were making another painful walk north to see if their homes were still standing and their families still alive.</p> <p>Mothers and fathers were still scraping around for morsels of food and sips of dirty water to give to their emaciated children.&nbsp;</p> <p>All this absurd hyperbole is not funny. It is extremely alarming.&nbsp;Trump declared that the \"war is over\". It is not. This must be understood.</p> <p>A ceasefire is not the end of a war.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>None of the underlying conditions have been dealt with. Israel maintains its unlawful occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. Its soldiers have continued to kill Palestinians in both, thankfully at far reduced rates.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is not a peace deal nor comprehensive. It is a ceasefire proposal with certain points about future stages. It is so vague that the devil is in the lack of details. Peace would require agreement on borders, Jerusalem, sovereignty, refugees, amongst a host of other issues. Negotiations require the acceptance of a Palestinian partner.&nbsp;</p> <p>Confusing a ceasefire with the endpoint and a permanent peace is exactly what was the case on 6 October 2023. Whilst there was largely peace for Israel and Israelis, life under military occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was utter hell and worsening.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <h3>Genuine accountability</h3> <p>The summit also gave the appearance of enormous momentum and unity, that nothing could halt the inexorable march towards a utopian Middle East-wide peace.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-text align-right\"> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Trump's 20-point plan for 'peace' is a call for Palestinian surrender</div> <div class=\"mee-readmore-author\">Mohamad Elmasry</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/trumps-20-point-plan-peace-call-palestinian-surrender\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Yet in the real world, the ceasefire nearly broke down because Hamas could not locate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/hamas-hostage-bodies-recovered-amid-israel-gaza-fighting-ceasefire-deal\">the remaining dead hostages </a>under the 61 million tonnes of rubble.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every leader proclaimed how wonderful the deal was but then gave their own version of what that deal entailed.

The reality was nothing changed. Gaza was kept under lock and key. Israel then violated each and every single ceasefire deal.&nbsp;</p> <p>Leaders need to jettison the overblown rhetoric and get their teams knee-deep in the dirty details. It requires hard persistent graft that will get no headlines.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/29/heres-the-full-text-of-trumps-20-point-plan-to-end-israels-war-on-gaza\">The Trump-Netanyahu 20 point-plan</a>&nbsp;needs to be completely revised, and fleshed out.

regional development model as an alternative to slow death and pollution\".</p> <p>In response to the protest, Saied criticised a lack of maintenance at the 53-year-old plant and dispatched a team

Implementing such an investment restriction would be as easy for Oxford as it has been to implement its existing restrictions,” Perry said.</p> <h3>Push for transparency</h3> <p>Both the university and BDS coalition members on campus emphasise that the amount of money that Oxford has invested in the BlackRock fund is very small compared to the university’s total endowment.</p> <p>But the coalition, which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://oxfordbds.github.io/data/Oxford_OHCHR.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">first uncovered and analysed</a>&nbsp;the fund, says it is important because the vast majority of the rest of the university’s company-level holdings have not been disclosed.</p> <p>The group points specifically to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ouem.co.uk/the-oxford-endowment-fund/\">Oxford Endowment Fund</a> (OEF), an investment vehicle in which the university, most of its colleges and several external UK charities pool their capital,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>which the coalition says \"dwarfs the fund investigated in this article\".</p> <blockquote> <p>'The endowment of the collegiate university is the largest endowment in the UK, however no information is publicly available about the investments of this fund'</p> <p><em>- Oxford BDS Coalition</em></p> </blockquote> <p>\"The [OEF] is worth over £7bn as of the <a href=\"https://www.ouem.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OEF-Report-2024.pdf\">most recent report</a> from its manager, Oxford University Endowment Management (OUEM).
