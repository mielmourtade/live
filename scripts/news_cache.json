The foreign desk had a dedicated team of sub-editors.</p> <p>But it also had its weird and wonderful ways.</p> <p>It was a writer’s newspaper, and correspondents set the agenda for the news desk; not, as it is today, the other way round. Our man in Paris was unreachable because he refused to have a telephone. Others took time to file, sometimes weeks.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>The Guardian was so full of typos, with a printing press in Gray’s Inn Road that expired regularly after the first edition, that it soon became known as the Grauniad.</p> <p>It had one other quirk. It employed journalists of the same name. There were two Paul Websters, one our Paris correspondent and the other the foreign editor.</p> <p>There were also two David Hirsts, or at least that is how it appeared in Arabic.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/colleagues-praise-fearless-david-hirst-after-journalists-death-aged-89\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/HIRST_ARAFAT_2001.jpg.webp?itok=78nCzV6I\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Colleagues praise 'fearless' David Hirst after journalist's death aged 89</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/colleagues-praise-fearless-david-hirst-after-journalists-death-aged-89\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>There was the man I referred to as “the real David Hirst”, the distinguished Arabist who wrote the seminal work <em>The Gun and the Olive Branch</em>, who escaped kidnap twice in Beirut at the height of the civil war, who broke exclusives on the sacking of Hama by Hafez Assad and the gassing of the Kurds in Halabja by Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>And there was me: young, willing and ignorant. The family name had been changed hurriedly in 1943 aboard a British frigate heading for the landing beaches near Salerno in Italy during the Second World War.</p> <p>A captain in the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk\">British</a> army, my father was told by his major that British troops could not go into combat led by an officer with a German name.</p> <p>An Austrian Jew, my father was doubly insulted. He anglicised Hirshtritt to Hearst to distinguish himself from the riffraff of Hirsts and Hursts all around him.</p> <p>Foreseeing the reputational damage I could do to my more distinguished and wholly innocent colleague, I chose a different area of the world to operate in and learned Russian.</p> <h3>The doppelganger effect</h3> <p>But, as it does, the Middle East dragged me back into its centre of gravity like a force of nature, and rather like the plot of Evelyn Waugh’s <em>Scoop</em>, the two Hirsts became fused into one in the minds of many of our readers.</p> <p>I used to receive his BBC cheques. An <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iran\">Iranian</a> diplomat I was interviewing refused to believe, after multiple denials over 90 minutes, that I had not escaped kidnap in Beirut.</p> <p>A room full of admirers in Ottawa, each bearing a copy of <em>The Gun and Olive Branch</em> for me to sign, was about to gather until I cottoned on and stopped it. The internet only made the doppelganger effect worse.</p> <blockquote> <p>Hirst’s book grew in stature and, as one edition succeeded another, it grew in size as well as by reputation</p> </blockquote> <p>Hirst and I only interacted briefly towards the very end of his long career on the Guardian, and, as it turned out, the end of mine too.</p> <p>In the Blairite Britain of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Guardian made a conscious decision to turn its back on the left, the unions, and its own non-conformist Mancunian roots, to seek brighter horizons in the US.</p> <p>This failed, with much gnashing of teeth over the costs involved. The <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/united-states\">US</a> had its own liberal media, thank you very much, and did not want to be lectured on how to vote by the Brits.</p> <p>After several attempts at landing on the East Coast, the Guardian was left floating in mid-Atlantic, rather like Blair himself.</p> <p>In consequence, Hirst found it difficult to get published in the newspaper to which he had filed for four decades.</p> <p>His long, academic essays were passed around from foreign to feature desk and back again like hot potatoes no one wanted to handle.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>This was richly undeserved because, while they did not fit easily into the tighter and more rigidly designed Berliner format, they were brilliant works of analysis and journalism.</p> <p>Not one word was out of place in his famously long sentences and woe begat the sub-editor who moved a comma.</p> <p>Hirst was of that fearless generation who were unfazed by fashion, popular opinion, or orthodoxy.</p> <h3>The Gun and the Olive Branch</h3> <p><em>The Gun and the Olive Branch: The Roots of Violence in the Middle Eas</em>t, to give it its full title, is a merciless and clinical denunciation of Zionism as a settler colonial project.</p> <p>It was published at the least favourable moment for such an undertaking, in 1977, the year that <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt\">Egyptian</a> President Anwar Sadat visited Jerusalem and the world was feverish about peace in our time.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Hirst was one of the few who dissented. His book was denounced by the very few newspapers that dared print a review.</p> <p>The only major newspaper to touch it at the time, the Washington Post, called it “an accusative sniffle amid the open chords of an anthem of hope”.</p> <blockquote> <p>Hirst’s words do read as true and as accurate today as they did when they were written</p> </blockquote> <p>The New Republic called it “the most malignantly anti-Israeli book ever to be published in English by someone who claims to be a serious commentator”.</p> <p>In contrast, when Joan Peters published her dramatic rewriting of history, <em>From Time Immemorial: The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict over Palestine</em>, to claim that the Palestinians were no more native to the land than the Zionist immigrants were, her work was lionised.</p> <p>For Ronald Sanders, author of a study of the Balfour Declaration, her work “could change the entire polemic over <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestine</a>”.</p> <p>Martin Peretz, editor of the New Republic, declared that “it will change the mind of our generation. If understood, it could also affect the history of the future”.</p> <p>How little has changed. But Hirst’s book grew in stature and, as one edition succeeded another, it grew in size as well as by reputation.</p> <h3>Oslo Accords&nbsp;</h3> <p>Hirst wrote of the Oslo Accords that PLO leader Yasser Arafat signed with <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\">Israeli</a> Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in September 1993: “It was the first formal step in the process of de-colonisation to which all such European colonial enterprises had submitted, and yet at the same time, the Jewish State being that great exception which proves the rule, it was also to be a last and very limited one.</p> <p>“For it was of course the Palestinians who, on any true historical reckoning, had made the real concession; for them historically it was pure loss against pure Israeli gain. By his own standards, Arafat’s retreat had been breathtaking, incomparably greater than Sadat’s which 16 years before he had denounced as an ‘apostasy’.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/trump-blair-chilling-plan-gaza-no-room-palestinian-holocaust\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/palestine-gaza-graves-deir-al-balah-june-2025-eyad-baba-afp.jpg.webp?itok=RoeT4tw_\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Trump Gaza plan: Blair joins the vultures feeding on a Palestinian Holocaust</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/trump-blair-chilling-plan-gaza-no-room-palestinian-holocaust\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>“His formal renunciation of 78 percent of historic Palestine had been foreseen. But in addition he had virtually given up the idea of Return for all those, half the Palestinian people, who had been driven out in 1948 and 1967 and ever after regarded it as the supreme goal of the struggle.”</p> <p>Journalism is known as the first draft of history for a reason, and it is rare that its instant judgements stand the test of time. But Hirst’s words do read as true and as accurate today as they did when they were written.</p> <p>Hirst was not a journalist who wrote about himself. He had to be persuaded to file the day he escaped kidnap, and even then his description was sparse, because he rightly thought more attention should be given to all the other evils his beloved Beirut, where he lived on the Corniche, was enduring.</p> <p>I am proud to have published his <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/users/david-hirst\">last two essays</a> in Middle East Eye, one of which we <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/gaza-israel-genocide-going-mad-is\">republish</a> today.</p> <p>I don’t know if Hirst tried to have them published in the Guardian but I am pretty sure what their answer would have been.</p> <p>The Guardian’s loss was MEE’s gain.</p> <p>I salute my namesake and only wish all of us can carry on his work and live up to his standards.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/media\" hreflang=\"en\">Media</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

He envisaged Syria and Iraq being fragmented into ethnic or religious cantons as Israel's primary targets in the east.</p> <p>On the western front, he argued for breaking Egypt into distinct geographical regions, predicting that if it were to splinter, countries such as Libya and Sudan would not survive in their present form.</p> <p>This overarching plan does not capture the full polemical tone of the document, but it conveys its essence: Israeli hegemony through the political weakening and balkanisation of the Arab world.</p> <p>A decade later, Bernard Lewis, the academic icon of Zionist strategists, offered a similar outlook.</p> <p>In 1992, shortly after the Cold War, he sketched two paths for the region: either a single Arab regional hegemony - a scenario the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a> would have to prevent, as it had done against Iraq's Saddam Hussein - or a breakup of regional states in a process Lewis <a href=\"https://hmjackson.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Rethinking-the-Middle-East-Lewis.pdf\">coined</a> \"Lebanonisation\".</p> <p>He argued that many Middle Eastern countries were recent artificial constructions, characterised by weak social cohesion and a lack of common identity. If a state's central authority collapsed, he wrote, it would splinter into sects, tribes, regions and parties. Later that year, he <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/1992-09-01/rethinking-middle-east\">expanded</a> this thesis in Foreign Affairs under the title \"Rethinking the Middle East\".</p> <p>Within a decade, several neoconservative disciples of Lewis, including Paul Wolfowitz, <a href=\"https://risingtidefoundation.net/2023/11/27/the-clean-break-doctrine-a-modern-day-sykes-picot-waging-war-and-havoc-in-the-middle-east/\">Richard Perle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dougfeith.com/docs/Clean_Break.pdf\">Douglas Feith</a> and <a href=\"https://scotthorton.org/fairuse/coping-with-crumbling-states-a-western-and-israeli-balance-of-power-strategy-for-the-levant-by-david-wurmser-1996/\">David Wurmser</a>, would play leading roles in breaking up <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iraq\">Iraq</a> and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/iraq-war\">devastating</a> the region during the George W Bush administration.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>They made no secret of the fact that such policies were pursued primarily for the benefit of the Zionist regime.</p> <h3>Periphery doctrine</h3> <p>Well before Yinon, David Ben-Gurion's periphery <a href=\"https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/166559/b151938c198b0872c368a0eacebe96f0.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">doctrine</a> sought alliances with non-Arab states and minorities on the Arab world's edges, such as pre-1979 <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iran\">Iran</a>, pre-AKP&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey\">Turkey</a>, and Ethiopia. It also relied on sub-state actors like the Kurds in northern Iraq, the Sudan People's Liberation Army in southern Sudan, and the Maronites in Lebanon.</p> <p>From the late 1950s onward, the policy materialised in discreet ties with Iraqi Kurds and, in Lebanon, coordination with Christian militias that culminated in Israel's 1982 invasion.</p> <p>Former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin <a href=\"https://www.jta.org/archive/begin-says-israel-will-act-if-lebanese-christians-are-attacked\">stated</a> the minority logic bluntly in 1980 when he said: \"If the Christian minority in Lebanon is attacked...Israel will not remain passive.\"</p> <p class=\"text-align-center\"></p> <p>More than four decades later, the Zionist regime has frequently attacked Syria under the pretext of protecting its Druze minority.</p> <p>In his attempt to justify bombing Syria's military assets and seizing more land, Netanyahu cynically appealed to the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/israel-aggression-syria-advances-century-long-zionist-strategy-co-opt-druze\">Syrian Druze</a> community two months ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/israel-says-airstrikes-in-syria-are-message-to-protect-druze-minority\">claiming</a> that Israel was \"acting to save [their] Druze brothers and to eliminate the gangs of the regime\".</p> <p>In Syria, as well as in Iraq, the past two decades of foreign-induced policies - pursuing regime change, instigating chaos, triggering civil wars, and encouraging de facto cantons - echo parts of Yinon's&nbsp;map.</p> <p>The result has been Kurdish autonomous areas, Druze and Alawite zones, and battered Sunni and Shia strongholds.</p> <p>Five months after Sudan's partition in July 2011, South Sudan President Salva Kiir <a href=\"https://www.algemeiner.com/2011/12/27/south-sudan-israel-establish-strong-alliance/\">said </a>during his first official visit to the Zionist state: \"Without you, we would not have been established.\"</p> <h3>'Security' borders</h3> <p>Across the Israeli political spectrum, leaders have repeatedly framed borders as security imperatives, not inviolable international lines.<br /> <br /> During the 1975 Sinai disengagement plan - later incorporated in the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt - Israeli leaders insisted on making the Sinai a buffer zone. Then Defence Minister Shimon Peres <a href=\"https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/sites/default/files/pdf_documents/library/document/0331/1553975.pdf\">said</a> Israel needed \"buffer zones and [an] Egyptian civilian-administered area\".</p> <blockquote> <p>Barrack's 'meaningless lines' are less about erasing borders on paper than about subordinating them to Israel's pursuit of regional hegemony</p> </blockquote> <p>Within days of the June 1982 <a href=\"https://www.palquest.org/en/highlight/168/lebanon-war-1982\">invasion</a> of Lebanon, Begin admitted the real reason behind the military assault when he informed&nbsp;Israel's parliament, the Knesset: \"As soon as the Israeli army establishes a secure 25-mile zone north of the Israeli frontier, our work will have been done.\"</p> <p>Similarly, then Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/pm-rabin-speech-to-knesset-on-ratification-of-oslo-peace-accords\">told</a> the Knesset in October 1995 - even after Oslo - that \"the security border of the State of Israel will be located in the Jordan Valley, in the broadest meaning of that term\".</p> <p>Three decades later, Netanyahu updated the formula for Gaza when he <a href=\"https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/se/date/2024-07-24/segment/04\">said</a> in 2024: \"We must retain overriding security control [there] for the foreseeable future.\"</p> <p>These declarations, across decades of expansionist operations and destabilising policies, give Barrack's remark historical depth.</p> <p>If Sykes-Picot traced straight lines across the regional map, successive Israeli leaders have sketched curves of control - annexations, corridors, valleys, belts, buffer zones - defined by coveted territories, surveillance, access, and the ability to strike without restraint.</p> <p>Barrack's \"meaningless lines\" are less about erasing borders on paper than about subordinating them to Israel's pursuit of regional hegemony.</p> <h3>Border shock</h3> <p>After the 7 October 2023 surprise attack, the Zionist regime's sacrosanct doctrine of \"defensible borders\" was shaken.</p> <p>In July 2024, Netanyahu carried the same menacing message to the US Congress. The Congressional Research Service <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/PDF/R47828/R47828.31.pdf\">summarised</a> it crisply, noting that Netanyahu had \"insisted that Israel have full security control of 'all territory west of the Jordan River,' and 'overriding security control' in Gaza for the foreseeable future.\"</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-the-big-story mee-readmore-type-text align-right\"> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">War on Gaza: How 7 October forever destroyed the myth of Israeli military invincibility</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/gaza-israel-7-october-destroyed-myth-military-invincibility\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>On the ground, the Zionist army's creation and expansion of a security zone in northern Gaza, and the enforcement of so-called \"humanitarian\" relocation areas such as al-Mawasi, further <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-troops-expand-security-zone-northern-gaza-2025-04-04/\">illustrate</a> how borders are being reconfigured as kill zones, corridors and gated conduits rather than classic state borderlines.</p> <p>Indeed, the Yinon Plan had long offered the maximalist framework, while Israel's response to 7 October supplied a genocidal pretext.</p> <p>For nearly two years, as it slaughters and displaces populations, the Zionist regime has openly pursued its expansionist agenda, unconstrained by international law or diplomacy and reliant on unconditional US support.</p> <p>On this course, Israel has exercised military freedom of action, instigated the weakening and fragmentation of bordering states, and cultivated minority and periphery ties to undercut Arab and Muslim majorities.</p> <p>Hence, Barrack's description of Sykes-Picot as \"meaningless lines\" underscores Israel's hegemonic logic as it arrogantly and recklessly pursues political, military and territorial dominance, or \"overriding control\".</p> <h3>Potential fallout</h3> <p>There are serious implications for US policy in the region when Israel is given the freedom to pursue its project of regional hegemony. If Israeli control of the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egyptian-Gaza border is allowed, friction with Washington's regional partners will intensify.</p> <p>It will also complicate <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt\">Egypt</a>'s security and diplomatic role, a political price the US will ultimately pay with Cairo and Gulf capitals it depends on to stabilise the region and safeguard its own interests.</p> <hr /> <p><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-gaza-war-live\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of Israel's genocide in Gaza</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <hr /> <p>If Gaza remains under the current Israeli genocidal policy and military control, while settlements and annexation continue in the West Bank, the US will be at odds with much of the world - underwriting and protecting a settler-colonial, apartheid-like project, not leading a path toward a political settlement.</p> <p>This endeavour will certainly complicate US efforts towards <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-normalisation-deals\">normalisation</a> with <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/saudi-arabia\">Saudi Arabia</a> and other regional states. As Israel escalates its onslaught in the Palestinian territories and sustains clashes in Lebanon, Syria, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/yemen\">Yemen</a> and possibly Iran - as well as sporadic strikes in Tunisia and Qatar - Washington will not only lose leverage in the region but also see its security and economic interests threatened.</p> <p>The more Washington expends resources backing Israel, the less capacity it has to contain or confront global rivals such as <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/china\">China</a> and Russia.</p> <p>Any serious challenge to Israeli hegemony must demand the restoration of rights across the communities and states it has transgressed, and affirm the legitimacy of resistance as the primary means of struggle.</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Smoke billows from Nabatieh district following Israeli strikes, as seen from Marjayoun in southern Lebanon, 31 August 2025 (Karamallah Daher/Reuters)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"Smoke billows from Nabatieh district following Israeli strikes, as seen from Marjayoun in southern Lebanon, 31 August 2025 (Karamallah Daher/Reuters)\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/2025-08-31T064324Z_88566812_RC26IGAXH3XB_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-LEBANON-STRIKES%281%29.jpg\" width=\"1920\" /> </div> <figcaption>Smoke billows from Nabatieh district following Israeli strikes, as seen from Marjayoun in southern Lebanon, 31 August 2025 (Karamallah Daher/Reuters)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>It must also be driven by regional actors, not dependent on alliances or entanglements with outside powers, especially the US, Israel's chief enabler.</p> <p>Since the onslaught of genocide in Gaza, the world has awakened to the righteousness of the Palestinian cause. The Zionist narrative has been debunked and its hasbara operations exposed.</p> <p>International institutions such as the UN General Assembly, the ICJ and the ICC have condemned Israel's hegemonic policies and genocidal conduct, while reasserting Palestinian rights, including the inalienable right of return. Human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have likewise issued reports denouncing Israel's actions in Gaza, the West Bank and across the region.</p> <p>Restoring those rights is not only a legal imperative rooted in self-determination, equal protection and the right of return, but also the strategic prerequisite for any durable regional order. Without the full restitution of land, life and liberty - including an end to occupation, siege, displacement and apartheid-like practices - instability will remain the region's default.</p> <p>Resistance, grounded in international law and centred on popular, political, legal and civic mobilisation, is therefore the indispensable tool to check Israeli hegemony. It shifts costs, disrupts impunity and compels accountability.</p> <h3>Beyond Sykes-Picot</h3> <p>Recently, in a rare candid moment, Netanyahu told a journalist in Hebrew that he is on a \"historic and spiritual mission\" and \"very attached to the vision of the Promised Land and Greater Israel\". His declaration captured the driving ideology behind Israel's wars, from the occupied Palestinian territories to Lebanon and Syria.</p> <p>Before that, Barrack's observation spread because it gave voice to a long-standing plan already set in motion: for Israel's leadership, internationally recognised borders are \"meaningless\" lines to be violated at will, while the only borders it upholds are those that trace its expansionist vision of <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/what-greater-israel\">Greater Israel</a> and serve its Zionist grand strategy.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-prove-israel-isnt-settler-colony-even-it-pursues-greater-israel\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/2025-07-12T133706Z_26442612_MT1SOPA000FZNC0A_RTRMADP_3_SOPA%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=-0AAnyjZ\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">How to prove Israel is not a settler colony even as it pursues 'Greater Israel'</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-prove-israel-isnt-settler-colony-even-it-pursues-greater-israel\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Whether this serves US interests depends on ends and timeframes.</p> <p>If the goal is short-term management by propping up regimes, blocking ceasefires, and reducing the crisis to aid corridors, then the current US policy will only further erode what little remains of its credibility and deepen instability, while writing unlimited cheques.</p> <p>But if the goal is a durable regional order, then Washington must confront a partner whose hegemonic strategy is built on fragmentation, belligerent force and condescension - and decide how much of that it is willing to bankroll and shield.</p> <p>For the peoples of the region, the answer is not to resurrect Sykes-Picot but to transcend it - building a post-Sykes-Picot order grounded in sovereignty and independence, where unity is the basis of strength, and where corridors carry aid and trade rather than tanks.</p> <p>Only an order that rejects Israel's redrawn map of domination can defend land and liberty, achieve justice for Palestine, and secure stability for the region.<br /> <br /> <em>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</em></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

It’s terribly hard. I’m living in denial, especially now that everyone around me has left and the city is emptying.”</p> <p>Despite the growing danger, she remained determined to stay in Gaza City “until the last gasp”.</p> <p>“We don’t know what that last gasp is, or how long it will be. But yes, we always say we’ll stay until the point where it’s impossible to stay - and then we’ll go,” she said.</p> <p>“Honestly, I don’t know how I’ll leave or where to go. There’s literally no place left in the city, and the area they’re trying to confine us to is very small.”</p> <blockquote> <p>'Sooner or later, I’ll have to leave. It’s out of my hands. A day will come - against my will - when I’ll have to leave Gaza'</p> <p><em>- Maha Hussaini, Palestinian journalist</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Adding to her anguish is the mass exodus she’s witnessed over recent days.</p> <p>“The streets are so empty - when you walk around, it doesn’t feel like Gaza anymore,” she said.</p> <p>“Gaza used to be lively and full of life. Now, you barely see anyone.”</p> <p>Still, Hussaini recognised that delaying the inevitable would not stop it from happening.</p> <p>“I just know, sooner or later, I’ll have to leave. It’s out of my hands. No matter how much I try to prolong this period, a day will come - against my will - when I’ll have to leave Gaza.</p> <p>“As you know, one tries as much as possible to extend the time, to stay longer in Gaza, to drink it all in.”</p> <p>On Wednesday, just days after this interview, Hussaini was finally forced to flee south, having run out of safe places to stay in Gaza City.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor\"> <div><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/users/huthifa-fayyad\" hreflang=\"en\">Huthifa Fayyad</a></div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\">Jerusalem</div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
