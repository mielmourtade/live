So far, more than 2,000 people have been killed on their way to or near distribution centres, and thousands more have been wounded.</p> <h3>The chaos is the point</h3> <p>The recurring motif of GHF’s humanitarian aid distribution is chaos.&nbsp;</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a>-backed organisation operates four distribution sites - one in central Gaza and three in the south.

By quick calculation, that is less than a quarter of the rations needed in Gaza during that period. Some of the supply makes its way to the market: individuals sell flour to buy healthier or more varied food, or traders and profiteers send people to grab supplies and then resell them at exorbitant prices.</p> <p>Chaos also reigns in site security. A guard from UG Solutions, hired to secure the sites, <a href=\"https://zeteo.com/p/exclusive-american-security-contractor&amp;nbsp\">said</a> the company never vetted its employees. It didn’t even check if they knew how to use the weapons provided.&nbsp;</p> <p>Another UG Solutions worker <a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/1950210274813681964\">said</a> guards entered Gaza on tourist visas, even though they carried automatic weapons and were authorised to use them against civilians.&nbsp;</p> <p>Both guards <a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/1950210274813681964&amp;nbsp\">said</a> they did not receive rules of engagement.

International aid agencies have condemned the arrangement and refused to cooperate, but Israel and the US continue pressuring them to hand over their aid to GHF.&nbsp;</p> <p>In other words, they are asking the international community to bankroll feeding Gaza’s population while ethnic cleansing carries on apace in the north and centre of the Palestinian enclave.</p> <p>Inside Israel, GHF faces eroding legitimacy.

The Teder music club <a href=\"https://www.ha-makom.co.il/1059967-2/\">publicly</a>&nbsp;distanced itself from Shahar Segal, one of its partners who served as GHF’s spokesperson. On 12 and 19 August, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gadi.algazi/posts/pfbid0HSun3n9Ma9kRrG5HrWhsbKvtYVHNeY2i7uN4CMGjNq8hdBcXtGLQdU4HgeeDBBJFl&amp;nbsp\">protests</a> were held in Israel outside the hotel where GHF managers were staying.&nbsp;</p> <p>International criticism of GHF’s model is also intensifying. In late June, for example, 15 organisations called on GHF and its contractors to halt operations, citing violations of international law and ties to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.&nbsp;</p> <p>Aid agencies argue GHF is not a humanitarian organisation at all, since it does not adhere to neutrality, independence and humaneness - the core principles of humanitarian aid. Central to these principles is refusing to turn aid into a tool of forced population transfer, which is why Israel dismisses international demands as “surrender to Hamas”.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet GHF’s model in Gaza is only one small piece of a much larger problem: the unravelling of the international order established after World War Two.</p> <p>Some see GHF’s approach as a model worth copying. The profit is clear: large sums change hands; guards earn high wages; companies and entrepreneurs awarded contracts take handsome cuts.&nbsp;</p> <p>The losers are those too weak to run for food parcels, and those unlucky enough to be shot on their way there or back. In the longer term, the silent acquiescence of the world’s governments to this arrangement accelerates the breakdown of the international order, harms vulnerable populations now and in the future, and stains wealthier societies with a lasting moral blot.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/analysis\" hreflang=\"en\">Analysis</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor\"> <div><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/users/lee-mordechai\" hreflang=\"en\">Lee Mordechai</a></div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

At the centre of it all was a live-streamed message from billionaire Elon Musk, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/14/uk/elon-musk-uk-government-far-right-rally-intl\">declaring</a>: “You either fight back or you die.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Let us be clear: this is not an organic, working-class uprising. It is a movement fuelled by the ultra-rich, amplified by digital platforms, and cloaked in the language of white working-class redemption. It is exploitation masquerading as populism, and the stakes have never been higher.</p> <p>Musk’s presence at the rally was not incidental.&nbsp;It reflects the growing alignment between techno-oligarchs and far-right populists.&nbsp;</p> <p>When the world’s richest man, owner of X (formerly Twitter), SpaceX and Tesla, beams into a London protest and proclaims that “violence is coming”, it signals not only the legitimisation of extremist rhetoric, but also the power of digital platforms to coordinate and embolden it.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Musk’s political trajectory has followed a familiar pattern: from libertarian technocrat, to cultural reactionary, to open amplifier of far-right conspiracism. His calls for the dissolution of parliament and scorn for the “elite” are not policy positions, but ideological signals aimed at destabilising democratic norms in favour of deregulation, authoritarianism and digitally consolidated power.</p> <p>We are witnessing the construction of digital fiefdoms: ideological ecosystems ruled by billionaire lords, policed by algorithms, and populated by millions of people who feel alienated by the political establishment. In these spaces, anger is harvested, redirected and monetised. Political rage becomes engagement; engagement becomes capital.</p> <h3>Hollowed-out towns</h3> <p>If the rhetoric of the far right remained online only, it might be dismissed as hyperbole. But its consequences are already unfolding in the streets, with most hate crimes in the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk\">UK</a> being <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-year-ending-march-2024/hate-crime-england-and-wales-year-ending-march-2024\">racially motivated</a>, according to government data.&nbsp;</p> <p>When political leaders and media personalities repeatedly frame migrants, Muslims and other minorities as “invaders” or “threats to civilisation”, they license violence. The rallying cry of the populist right is that it speaks for the “forgotten man”.&nbsp;</p> <p>And there is a grim truth at the heart of this claim: many white working-class communities have been neglected - by the market, by neoliberalism, and most damningly, by the contemporary left.</p> <blockquote> <p>If the left wants to win that war, it must remember its roots - not in Twitter threads or metropolitan think-tanks, but in the lived realities of working-class people of all colours and creeds</p> </blockquote> <p>In post-industrial Britain, once-proud towns have been hollowed out by decades of austerity, under-investment and wage stagnation. The social infrastructure that held working-class life together - union halls, council housing, reliable public services - has been dismantled. In its place, populist demagogues offer pride, purpose and identity.</p> <p>But their solution is not redistribution or empowerment. It is scapegoating. It is division. It is false redemption that puts the blame on Muslims, migrants and current democratic structures, while quietly advancing a corporate agenda of deregulation, privatisation and digital monopolies.</p> <p>The irony is brutal: the white working class, in its search for power and its fight-back against the “elite”, is being led by the hand into the service of power itself.</p> <p>And where, one might ask, is the Labour Party in all of this? Under Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s cautious centrism, the party has embraced a platform of technocratic stability; what critics now call “reform-lite”. It offers modest adjustments, not moral vision or conviction. It is a politics designed not to inspire hope, but to remain stranded in the grey pond of stagnation and dismay.</p> <p>In a country where entire regions feel abandoned - economically, culturally and politically - a managerial left cannot compete with an insurgent right promising transformation, however illusionary.</p> <h3>Speaking across divisions</h3> <p>Even those to the left of Labour - the Greens, independents and democratic socialists - have too often failed to address the white working class directly. Many feel that doing so may entail cultural compromise. Others have simply misread the terrain. The result is a vacuum, and nature abhors a vacuum.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>The way out is neither to ignore white working-class grievances, nor to pander to extreme far-right sentiment. It is to reconstruct a universal, democratic class politics that speaks across divisions, while confronting hate without compromise.</p> <p>This will require the left to do things differently, and to shatter the stagnant status quo. Firstly, it must re-engage economically abandoned areas - not just through policy, but with a physical presence, including local campaigns, unions and cooperative initiatives.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-media-are-helping-reform-carry-out-flag-coup\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/flags-newcastle.jpg.webp?itok=2Uwbw8rP\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Flags, Farage and hotels: How the media is driving England into the arms of Reform</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-media-are-helping-reform-carry-out-flag-coup\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Secondly, the left must acknowledge grievances specific to the white working-class identity, without sanctifying it. Cultural recognition is not racial essentialism; it is the first step towards rebuilding political trust.</p> <p>Thirdly, the left must build bridges between communities, not walls - a process that should emphasise the shared material interests among working-class people of all backgrounds. It must confront the far right directly, naming their rhetoric for what it is: dangerous, manipulative and deeply anti-working class.</p> <p>Finally, the left needs to reclaim the language of nation and belonging - not by exclusion, but by rooting it in solidarity, mutual aid and democratic participation.</p> <p>The left must understand that if it does not offer belonging, meaning and material hope - if it does not listen in order to understand - others will, and on far more dangerous terms.</p> <p>We are at a critical junction. Far-right movements are growing not in the shadows, but in broad daylight, with corporate endorsement, billionaire amplification and real-world consequences. Musk’s words - “You either fight back or you die” - are more than hyperbole. They are a declaration of ideological war, not just on migrants or Muslims, but on democracy itself.</p> <p>If the left wants to win that war, it must remember its roots - not in Twitter threads or metropolitan think tanks, but in the lived realities of working-class people of all colours and creeds. Until then, the far right will continue to occupy the ground it has been ceded.</p> <p>And Britain will continue its drift into something colder, darker and far more dangerous than discontent.</p> <p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/racism\" hreflang=\"en\">Racism</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

The measure builds on <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/news/egypt-pushing-nato-regional-force-after-israeli-doha-strike\">past proposals</a> for a joint military alliance, but suggests that work could soon begin to \"put in place the required implementation mechanisms\".</p> <blockquote> <p>The assistant secretary general of the Arab League&nbsp;said that setting up the Joint Arab Defence Agreement is unrealistic since Arab states do not agree on a 'common enemy'</p> </blockquote> <p>The Gulf Cooperation Council (<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/gcc\">GCC</a>) then <a href=\"https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2025/09/15/gcc-calls-for-activating-joint-defense-mechanism-in-response-to-israeli-attack-on-doha\">announced</a> an urgent meeting of its Joint Defence Council to discuss \"activating the council's joint defence mechanism\" in response to Israel's strike on Doha.</p> <p>In his address, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey\">Turkish</a> President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Muslim countries to completely sever<a href=\"https://ilkha.com/english/world/erdogan-islamic-world-has-power-to-stop-israel-s-expansionist-dreams-479388\">&nbsp;economic ties</a> with Israel, while Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim insisted that all Muslim states end <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/malaysian-premier-urges-end-to-diplomatic-trade-ties-with-israel-seeks-support-for-gaza-flotilla/3688456\">diplomatic relations</a> with Israel.</p> <p>Article 15 of the communique reinforces both demands, calling on all Arab and Muslim states to sanction Israel and review \"diplomatic and economic relations\" with it.</p> <p>During his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiNYfUNOmQ4\">speech</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt\">Egyptian</a> President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi also struck a noticeably different tone than usual. He referred to Israel as \"the enemy\" and warned Israeli citizens that its government's actions have jeopardised the Camp David peace accord with Egypt.</p> <p>But as analysts have already <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9dDhx75a-E\">pointed out</a>, divisions and differences may ultimately prevent substantive action from being taken.</p> <p>For example, significant political differences between Arab states make it highly unlikely that they will agree to activate any kind of joint defence force.</p> <p>In a media interview, Hossam Zaki, the assistant secretary general of the Arab League, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeeramubasher.net/news/2025/9/15/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B8%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%81-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A9\">said</a> that setting up the Joint Arab Defence Agreement is unrealistic since Arab states do not agree on a \"common enemy\".</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>If this is the case at the level of the 22-member Arab League, then it is even more true for the 57-member OIC.</p> <hr /> <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/israel-rejects-hamas-truce-offer-thousands-forced-flee-gaza-city\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of Israel's genocide in Gaza</i></b></a></p> <hr /> <p>It is equally unlikely that the much smaller GCC - consisting of only six countries - will activate its joint defence mechanism, given divergent Israel ties, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US</a> security dependencies, and conflicting threat perceptions among members.</p> <p>Two Gulf countries, the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/united-arab-emirates\">United Arab Emirates</a> and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/bahrain\">Bahrain</a>, signed <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-gulf-states-became-business-partners-israels-occupation\">accords</a> with Israel in 2020 and have especially strong <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/what-are-the-limits-of-uae-israel-partnership\">diplomatic</a> and economic <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-normalisation-deals\">ties</a> to Israel.

It is also possible that there will be some meaningful movement, even if only on the part of individual states.</p> <p>Shortly before the attack on Qatar, Turkey <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war\">severed</a> all economic ties with Israel. However, that development, combined with the general spirit of the summit, may motivate other states to consider this option.</p> <p>Although it seems unlikely that countries party to the Abraham Accords will walk away from them, it seems very likely that no other countries will consider an accord with Israel in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Another military attack on Qatar - or any other GCC state - may cancel the accords altogether and prompt a complete rethinking of the region's security relationship with the US.</p> <p>The question now is whether the summit will cause Israel to think twice about future attacks on Arab and Muslim countries, or whether it may force Israel to consider winding down the war on Gaza.</p> <h3>Strategic reckoning</h3> <p>Israel has recently <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/un-western-powers-recognise-phantom-palestine-state-safeguard-israel\">attacked</a> seven states or territories: the West Bank and Gaza, Qatar, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/yemen\">Yemen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/syria\">Syria</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/lebanon\">Lebanon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iran\">Iran</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/tunisia\">Tunisia</a>.</p> <p>As Arab and Muslim leaders prepared to gather in Doha, Israel displayed brazen disregard, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hosting American Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p> <p>The two <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/rubio-opens-israel-visit-with-netanyahu-at-western-wall-amid-gaza-ops-qatar-fallout/\">prayed</a> together at the Wailing Wall before holding a joint <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCq2Mcn7X6M\">press conference</a> that overlapped with the summit.</p> <p>There, Netanyahu doubled down on his pledge to strike Hamas leaders wherever they are, even offering justification for the policy.</p> <p>Rubio was asked twice about Israel's 9 September attack on Qatar. Both times, he refused to condemn it, instead echoing Israeli propaganda almost verbatim, citing Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/antisemitism\">antisemitism</a>, demands for Hamas to surrender and disarm, Israeli captives, and alleged \"human shields\" in Gaza.</p> <p class=\"text-align-center\"></p> <p>The messages sent by the visit and press conference were clear: Israel and the United States are a tag team; Israel has no intention of changing course; and the US has no plan to rein it in.</p> <p>For Arab and Muslim capitals, the takeaway is stark: Washington will neither deter nor punish Israeli strikes on Arab soil.</p> <p>That reality underscores a deeper warning: from the perspective of both Israel and the US, the \"<a href=\"https://dohanews.co/sabotage-as-strategy-the-israeli-pursuit-of-greater-israel/\">Greater Israel</a>\" project remains firmly on course, and another Israeli attack in pursuit of this goal now appears inevitable.</p> <p>This should force an immediate strategic reckoning in the Gulf, the wider Arab region and the OIC: if the US will not reliably shield its partners, then Arab and Muslim countries must calibrate their own deterrence - through sanctions, airspace restrictions, and credible defence alliances.</p> <p>If words are not matched by actions, it is just a matter of time before the next emergency summit.</p> <p><em>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</em></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/diplomacy\" hreflang=\"en\">Diplomacy</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
