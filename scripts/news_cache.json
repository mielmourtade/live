Between 1922 and 1940, as a result of Jewish migration out of Europe, the Jewish population in Palestine&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Palestine/The-Arab-Revolt\" target=\"_blank\">grew more than five</a>fold to over 467,000, around one third of the total population.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Jewish land ownership more than <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestine-strike-history-explained-revolt\">doubled</a> from 60,100 to 155,200 hectares. The period saw the British facilitating land grabs and evicting entire villages.</p> <p>In April 1936, the Arab National Committee in Nablus announced a general strike against mandatory rule. It was brutally suppressed by British forces.</p> <p>This led to what is commonly known as the Arab revolt from 1936 to 1939, a period of armed resistance that saw the British declare martial law in Palestine.</p> <p>The film stars multiple well-known actors, including Jeremy Irons as the British high commissioner, Liam Cunningham as another British official and <em>Succession's </em>Hiam Abbass as a Palestinian villager turned rebel.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"A scene from Palestine 36. \" class=\"embedded-entity\" title=\"palfilm\"> <img alt=\"A scene from Palestine 36. \" height=\"2804\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/Screenshot_20251031_091035_YouTube.jpg\" title=\"palfilm\" width=\"4988\" /> </div> <figcaption>A scene from Palestine 36 shows rebels rallying local Palestinians (Screengrab)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p>The story follows Yusuf (Karim Daoud Anaya), a villager who works in Jerusalem for a wealthy, liberal magazine editor, and the editor's wife, writer Khouloud (Yasmine Al Massri), who publishes her articles under a male pseudonym.</p> <p>Yusuf starts off apolitical but eventually becomes a rebel in response to British atrocities.&nbsp;</p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>One of <em>Palestine 1936's</em> great strengths is its sophisticated depiction of diversity and divisions among Palestinians.</p> <p>The editor, Amir, is a member of the Muslim Association, which the film presents as a Zionist-funded body set up to undermine Palestinian nationalism.&nbsp;</p> <p>Khouloud becomes increasingly opposed to her husband's approach and ultimately embraces the revolt.</p> <p>The urban-rural divide is prominent in the film; harrowing scenes in which British soldiers torment Palestinian villagers are juxtaposed with scenes of lavish, wine-fuelled parties in Jerusalem in which upper-class Palestinians dance with British officials.</p> <p>Rural rebels are presented as the driving force behind first the general strike and then the violent rebellion.</p> <h3>'Their countries don't want them'</h3> <p>For all its strengths, the film is not without its blind spots. For example, it avoids controversial aspects of history, such as the omission of the crucial role played in the revolt by <a href=\"https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/1650769\">Izz al-Din al-Qassam</a>, after whom the armed wing of Hamas in Gaza is named.</p> <p>Qassam gets a single and surprising mention: \"As Qassam preached, it is better to die a martyr than to surrender,\" an elderly villager declares before soldiers kill him.&nbsp;</p> <p>Curiously, there are no Jewish characters with speaking roles. The focus is exclusively on Palestinians and a few British officials, and the overarching conflict in the film is between them.</p> <p>Billy Howle plays Thomas Hopkins, a conscience-stricken official who becomes increasingly outraged by British policy and prone to expletives as the story proceeds.</p> <p>Robert Aramayo plays Captain Orde Wingate, a fanatical anti-Palestinian racist and Christian Zionist.</p> <p></p> <p>There is no sense in the film that the Palestinian characters see Jewish settlers as enemies; the main villains for them are the British.&nbsp;</p> <p>In one early scene, a Palestinian girl asks her mother why Jewish migrants they see building a settlement have moved to Palestine. \"Their countries don't want them,\" her mother replies.</p> <p>The tone of the conversation is curious, even empathetic. It is worlds away from the mythical narrative common in pro-Israel discourse, which casts Palestinians as fanatical antisemites.</p> <p>Palestinian grievance, the film shows, was simply that their land and homes were being stolen.</p> <p>As Yusuf puts it succinctly in one scene: \"We are losing land daily, and many farmers have been evicted from their lands.\"</p> <h3>'Palestine was not Balfour's to give'</h3> <p>The climax of the film sees the unveiling of Britain's 1937 partition plan to split Palestine into two states, which would have entailed forcible displacement.</p> <p>It was a precursor to the eventual partition plan, which Palestinians rejected in 1947, setting the stage for war, the creation of Israel and the Nakba - the ethnic cleansing of at least 750,000 Palestinians.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-mee-life mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/how-israel-lost-hollywood-changing-face-western-art-palestine\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/phoenix-rooneymara-kaouther-ben-hania-venice-afp.jpg.webp?itok=L1pX5SqN\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">How Israel lost Hollywood: The changing face of western art on Palestine</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/how-israel-lost-hollywood-changing-face-western-art-palestine\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>It is often suggested by British commentators that&nbsp;Palestinians were somehow unreasonable to have rejected the partition plan. But the film depicts the British policy as a callous colonial betrayal.</p> <p>\"Is it the right of the English to distribute the land as they like?\" A dignified village elder asks an uncomfortable Hopkins in one scene.</p> <p>Later, protesting women address Lord Arthur Balfour's famous declaration of 1917, which declared British support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.</p> <p>\"Palestine was not Balfour's to give,\" they chant.</p> <p>The motivation for the revolt is summarised by one rebel leader: \"My friends, your country and jobs are being given away.</p> <p>\"Either we stand up for ourselves, or we sit back and watch.\"</p> <p><em>Palestine 36</em> is stirring, thought-provoking and devastating. It examines the roots of the bloody conflict still playing out today.</p> <p>This is a rare film that has been made with profound moral courage.

These included Shabbat as the state day of rest; kosher standards in state institutions, including the army and hospitals; personal status governed by religious law; and autonomy for Haredi education under the “independent education” framework.&nbsp;</p> <p>But conspicuously absent from that founding compromise was a clear settlement on military service.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <h3>Mass phenomenon</h3> <p>The exemption of Haredi yeshiva students from conscription emerged only after statehood, as a temporary concession to a shattered European Torah world - initially <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-06-27/ty-article/.premium/only-400-yeshiva-students-in-1948-israels-military-exemptions-through-the-years/00000190-592c-def3-a5b6-db2fe28b0000\">a few hundred</a> students spared in 1948.&nbsp;</p> <p>What began as narrow, exceptional relief gradually ballooned into a mass phenomenon: tens of thousands exempted, while public debate has&nbsp;raged in the background, with several <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/jerusalem-rocked-huge-ultra-orthodox-demonstration-against-army-conscription\">attempts made</a> to enshrine into law the ultra-Orthodox exemption from conscription.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the same time, Haredi Israelis have gone from constituting roughly <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/haredi-population-growing-twice-as-fast-as-total-israeli-population-report/\">10 percent</a> of the population in 2009 to around <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-coalition-jeopardised-over-ultra-orthodox-exemption-army-2025-03-18/\">14 percent</a> today - an increase measured in tens of thousands of people in just a decade and a half.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>Israel's delicate compromise between religion and state is cracking under the combined pressures of demographics, war and economic realities</p> </blockquote> <p>Rapid demographic growth concentrates young people in a community whose social and educational systems are often detached from core labour market skills such as English, maths and science. The result is a paradox: a community that receives substantial state support while remaining economically marginalised, and increasingly resentful of efforts to change that reality.</p> <p>These stresses have produced fractures inside the Haredi world. Deep hierarchies, rivalries between Lithuanian and Sephardi leaderships, and diverging attitudes towards Zionism and the state all complicate a single, unified response.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some factions remain fiercely <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/1/who-are-the-haredim-in-israel-and-what-are-their-demands\">anti-Zionist</a>, rejecting the legitimacy of the state; others pragmatically collaborate with secular coalitions to defend communal autonomy. Thursday’s <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/jerusalem-rocked-huge-ultra-orthodox-demonstration-against-army-conscription\">rally itself</a>, and the deliberate absence of political speeches, reflected these internal tensions: a show of mass force that nevertheless concealed real disagreements among Haredi leaders and constituencies.</p> <p>At the same time, new sociopolitical currents are reshaping the attitudes of younger Haredim. Exposure to smartphones and the internet, economic hardships, and increased contact with non-Haredi Israelis have radicalised some segments of the community and opened them to alternative political narratives.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some young Haredim have even <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/12/18/ultra-orthodox-jews-join-israeli-army-to-defend-their-country_6355501_4.html\">volunteered</a> for military service or joined extremist paramilitary units<b>&nbsp;-<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2024/4/25/what-is-netzah-yehuda-the-israeli-battalion-facing-possible-us-sanctions\">&nbsp;</a></b><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2024/4/25/what-is-netzah-yehuda-the-israeli-battalion-facing-possible-us-sanctions\">Netzah </a><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2024/4/25/what-is-netzah-yehuda-the-israeli-battalion-facing-possible-us-sanctions\">Yehuda</a>&nbsp;- an alarming development that has drawn international scrutiny.&nbsp;</p> <h3>Stark choice</h3> <p>Simultaneously, non-Haredi religious-nationalist politicians - most visibly the likes of National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir - have cultivated influence among some Haredi youth via social media, through messaging that blends religious symbolism with militant nationalism. These cross-currents have intensified tensions between Haredi rabbis and Religious Zionist clerical figures, for example over access to sensitive holy sites.</p> <p>What unites most Haredim right now is opposition to forced conscription. That opposition is not monolithic, however, and the coalition against conscription spans wildly different actors, from pragmatic communal leaders who fear the loss of religious autonomy, to ideologues who oppose the state on theological grounds.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/jerusalem-rocked-huge-ultra-orthodox-demonstration-against-army-conscription\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Oren%20Ziv%20MAIN.jpg.webp?itok=HnDVPWWp\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Jerusalem rocked by huge ultra-Orthodox demonstration against army conscription</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/jerusalem-rocked-huge-ultra-orthodox-demonstration-against-army-conscription\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>The state, for its part, faces a stark choice: preserve the old status quo - risking economic instability over the long term, and widening public resentment - or press for structural changes that will inevitably provoke political and social upheaval.</p> <p>The broader lesson of recent weeks is that Israel’s delicate compromise between religion and state is cracking under the combined pressures of demographics, war and economic realities. The government cannot indefinitely subsidise an educational ecosystem that leaves large cohorts unequipped for modern employment, while simultaneously demanding more soldiers for an expanding occupation.&nbsp;</p> <p>If the state seeks to maintain both a viable economy and its expansionist military agenda, it must find ways to integrate more Haredim into the workforce and national service, without causing mass protests and widespread disruption. If Haredi communities seek long-term viability, they must reopen their relationship with Zionism and state institutions.&nbsp;Neither path is easy, and both will be bitterly fought.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although this entire episode can be viewed as an internal Israeli affair among different social groups, it cannot be separated from the broader crisis Israel is generating within the Jewish world itself. This crisis is&nbsp;the consequence of the growing militarisation&nbsp;and the neoliberal policies that Israel upholds to sustain a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/netanyahu-super-sparta-vision-israel-economic-future-isolation\">Sparta-like state</a>, whose very existence revolves around maintaining a vast military apparatus.&nbsp;</p> <p>The implications of this reality extend far beyond Israel’s borders, shaping how the Jewish world understands itself and its moral relationship to power, war and nationhood.</p> <p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/inside-israel\" hreflang=\"en\">Inside Israel</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

After all, a little over two years after the 7 October attacks, with Israel’s unforgiving campaign of annihilation, a ceasefire was reached.&nbsp;</p> <p>Brokered by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\" target=\"_blank\">US</a>&nbsp;President Donald Trump, negotiations culminated in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/world-leaders-gather-in-egypt-for-signing-of-gaza-ceasefire-deal\" target=\"_blank\">ceremony</a>&nbsp;in Egypt on 13 October that celebrated \"peace in the Middle East\".

It is a white IL-76 heavy cargo transport plane, and it is parking next to a very similar aircraft.&nbsp;</p> <p>For local residents, the sound of such planes was unusual two years ago, when they first began landing in Bosaso. Not anymore. Moments later, undisclosed heavy logistical materials are seen being offloaded from the aircraft.</p> <p>“They’re frequent and the logistics are transferred immediately to another aircraft that is on standby and is destined for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/sudan\">Sudan</a> through the neighbouring countries,” said Abdullahi, a senior Puntland Maritime Police Force (PMPF) commander at Bosaso Airport, who spoke to Middle East Eye using a different name for security reasons.</p> <p>According to flight tracking data, satellite imagery, multiple local sources, and US and regional diplomats, the origin of these planes and their cargo is clear: the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uae\">United Arab Emirates</a>.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>The destination, as Abdullahi said, is Sudan and the RSF, which this week has <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/rsf-fighters-film-themselves-massacring-sudanese-fleeing-el-fasher\">captured el-Fasher</a>, the capital of North Darfur state, after over 500 days of siege. The paramilitary's fighters have committed terrible atrocities in the wake of their triumph, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/rsf-fighters-film-themselves-massacring-sudanese-fleeing-el-fasher\">filming themselves</a> massacring fleeing civilians and carrying out <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2025/10/29/rsf-fighters-film-execution-in-el-fasher-hospital-massacre\">mass executions </a>at hospitals.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over a period of months, a pattern could be seen in the cargo aircraft tracked by MEE coming into Bosaso.</p> <p>The planes would not remain long at the airport and would arrive during periods of minimal activity at the airport. Publicly available air traffic data shows that the UAE&nbsp;increasingly uses Bosaso Airport as the arrival times of the aircraft&nbsp;are sometimes changed.&nbsp;</p> <p>“During loading and offloading, they are heavily guarded, as they carry sensitive materials and logistics that are not publicly disclosed,” Abdullahi said. Supplies also come into the port at Bosaso.</p> <div alt=\"Bosaso base\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"Bosaso base\" height=\"1168\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/bosaso-base-somalia-puntland-mee.jpg\" width=\"1920\" /> </div> <p>For years, the UAE has been funding Puntland’s PMPF, a regional force established to combat piracy. The soldiers there say none of the materiel arriving on transport aircraft is brought to their camp, as the shipments are large and beyond their requirements.&nbsp;</p> <p>Flight tracking data <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-yemen-somalia-circle-bases-control-gulf-of-aden\">previously reported by MEE</a> has revealed that the UAE has significantly increased the supply of weapons into Bosaso, with US intelligence saying that these include Chinese-made drones.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>A senior manager at Bosaso’s port revealed for the first time to MEE that, for the past two years, the United Arab Emirates has funnelled over 500,000 containers marked as hazardous through Bosaso.</p> <p>Unlike standard cargo, which is documented with a letter of origin and destination, these Emirati shipments have no description of their contents. The port manager said that the logistics operations are shrouded in secrecy: upon arrival, the containers are swiftly transferred to the airport and loaded onto standby aircraft.</p> <p>Security for these shipments is exceptionally tight, MEE’s sources in Bosaso said. When a ship docks, PMPF forces are deployed to cordon off the port and prevent filming. Only personnel on duty are granted access, and they are explicitly warned against recording anything during the offloading and transit process.</p> <p></p> <p>The sources contended that the clandestine nature of the operation proves the goods were not for domestic use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“If they were, we would see where they were stored or find the empty containers,” the senior manager said. Instead, he said,&nbsp;“it was just transit”, meaning that Bosaso was a covert stopping point.&nbsp;</p> <p>Middle East Eye wrote to the government of the UAE and to regional authorities in Puntland requesting a response. Neither replied. The UAE has previously denied sponsoring the RSF.</p> <h3>Colombian mercenaries</h3> <p>Located on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden, Bosaso airport hosts several heavily fortified military facilities, including one occupied by UAE commanders and security personnel believed to be South Africans.</p> <p>To the north of the airport lies a separate camp housing <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sudan-ukraine-why-colombian-mercenaries-keep-fighting-foreign-wars\">Colombian mercenaries</a> involved in the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/sudan-war\">war in Sudan</a>.</p> <p>Pictures exclusively obtained by MEE show dozens of Colombians carrying backpacks disembarking from an aircraft at Bosaso airport and heading directly to the camp.&nbsp;</p> <p>When shown the images, Abdullahi immediately recognised them, saying: “Yes, they’re Colombian mercenaries operating from here in large numbers.”&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>The Colombian personnel arrive in Bosaso on international commercial flights, transiting through the airport almost every day before continuing on to Sudan, where they fight alongside the RSF.</p> <p>Somali soldiers from the PMPF, who are stationed at the airport, rarely have access to the Colombians’ camp. Abdullahi explained that “the mercenaries have built a new hospital within their compound, which they use to treat soldiers wounded in Sudan.</p> <p>“I recall one occasion when a plane carrying injured soldiers landed at Bosaso airport and the aircraft door was visibly stained with blood,” he said.</p> <p>The maritime police officer told MEE that the camp also serves as a medical transit point for wounded RSF fighters, who are later flown to other destinations for further treatment.</p> <p>Just next to the airport, the United Arab Emirates has installed a military radar system – believed to be French - designed to protect Bosaso airport from potential attacks.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-yemen-somalia-circle-bases-control-gulf-of-aden\">MEE reported recently</a>, Bosaso is connected to a ring of bases built and expanded by the UAE across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea. The bases, on the islands of Mayun, Abd al-Kuri, Samhah; at the Somaliland port of Berbera and the Yemeni port of Mocha, are all on territory nominally controlled not by the UAE but its allies or clients.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Bosaso satellite imagery\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"Bosaso satellite imagery\" height=\"913\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/google%20earth%20bosaso%20airport%20cargo%20plane.jpg\" width=\"1623\" /> </div> <figcaption>Satellite imagery shows the development of Bosaso (MEE)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>Soldiers stationed in Bosaso say the presence and activities of Colombian mercenaries in the area have become increasingly concerning, leaving many PMPF soldiers feeling unsafe.</p> <p>“We believe there is a high risk that the Sudanese government could target activities at Bosaso airport,” said Abdullahi.</p> <blockquote> <p>'A plane carrying injured soldiers landed at Bosaso airport and the aircraft door was visibly stained with blood'</p> <p>- <em>Abdullahi, Puntland Maritime Police Force officer</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Before Sudan’s war began in April 2023, the country offered scholarships to thousands of Somali students, with one of the notable beneficiaries of this scheme being Somalia’s current defence minister, Ahmed Moallim Fiqi.</p> <p>Several Puntland Maritime Police Force soldiers admit they are uneasy about cooperating with the foreign personnel involved in the Sudan war, fearing their work might indirectly support a genocide against a country they consider a close ally.</p> <p>At the beginning of the year, the US government <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/genocide-determination-in-sudan-and-imposing-accountability-measures/\">determined</a> that the \"members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan\", a conclusion that has been reached by many human rights groups.</p> <p>“I believe it’s morally unacceptable to assist mercenaries engaged in fighting a nation that has long supported Somalis - including members of my own family,” the soldier said.</p> <h3>Somalia and the UAE</h3> <p>For years, the United Arab Emirates has provided financial assistance to Mogadishu and trained Somali soldiers to combat armed groups such as al-Shabab.&nbsp;</p> <p>But this relationship has darkened significantly in recent years, as the UAE has aided and abetted regional administrations like Puntland and Somaliland, which have designs on splitting away from Somalia.</p> <blockquote> <p>'Mogadishu is unable to object, given that it is unprepared to counter the UAE’s expanding influence'</p> <p>-&nbsp;<em>Abdirashid Muse, analyst</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Mogadishu maintains control over Somali airspace and authorises all flights into the country, but it has no authority over Bosaso’s port and airport.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite the uneasy relationship that exists between Hassan Sheikh, Somalia’s president, and the UAE’s Mohammed bin Zayed, the government in Mogadishu has not openly confronted Abu Dhabi over its military activities in Puntland.</p> <p>“Mogadishu is unable to object, given that it is unprepared to counter the UAE’s expanding influence,” said Abdirashid Muse, a regional analyst and critic of the UAE’s activities in the Horn of Africa.</p> <p>He agrees with Abdullahi, noting that the UAE’s activities in Bosaso are deeply concerning, as they risk drawing Somalia into broader geopolitical rivalries among regional powers.</p> <p>Puntland’s state president, Said Abdullahi Deni, is widely regarded as a close ally of the UAE, largely due to the financial support that could strengthen both his administration and his political ambitions.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-the-big-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-yemen-somalia-circle-bases-control-gulf-of-aden\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/basoso-airport-somalia-google-earth.jpg.webp?itok=Jpqi9nXl\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">How the UAE built a circle of bases to control the Gulf of Aden</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-yemen-somalia-circle-bases-control-gulf-of-aden\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Meeting the UAE’s Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan recently, US President Donald Trump laughed and referred to him, on camera, as having “unlimited cash”.</p> <p>Martin Plaut, an academic specialising in conflicts in the Horn of Africa, said the UAE’s involvement in the war in Sudan is driven primarily by its interest in obtaining gold and expanding regional influence.</p> <p>In the case of Puntland, he said its strategic location and relative independence made it an ideal operational base for the UAE.</p> <p>“Puntland remains one of the least surveyed and overseen areas in the world. It’s simply a convenient place for the UAE to operate from - and nobody is going to ask them any questions,” Plaut told MEE.</p> <p>In July, Deputy Prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan of the International Criminal Court (ICC) told the UN Security Council that the ICC has “reasonable grounds to believe” that both war crimes and crimes against humanity are being committed in Sudan.</p> <p>“Puntland authorities could be complicit and may have a case to answer,” said Plaut.&nbsp;</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/sudan-war\" hreflang=\"en\">Sudan war</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
