But whether that means Mamdani is all but assured victory in three weeks' time may be another matter.</p> <p>The 33-year-old surprise frontrunner - in a race now being watched around the world - largely held his own at an event where all eyes were on his potential stumbles, particularly on the two subjects that have catapulted his brand: America's class divide, and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestine</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>A Fox News poll released on Friday - but conducted before the debate - showed Mamdani breaking the <a href=\"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/fox_october-10-14-2025_nyc-mayor_topline_october-16-release.pdf\">50 percent threshold</a> to widen his lead over his two main rivals: Independent candidate and former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa.&nbsp;</p> <p>Among likely voters, as of last week, 52 percent said they would vote for Mamdani compared to 28 percent who would vote for Cuomo. Sliwa trails behind with just 14 percent support.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Cuomo spent a decade running the state of New York before resigning in disgrace in 2020.

He had more than 10 years, and he couldn't name a single mosque at the last debate we had that he visited. And it took me to get you to even see those Muslims are part of this city, and that, frankly, is something that is shameful,\" Mamdani responded.</p> <p>\"I have denounced Hamas again and again. It will never be enough for Andrew Cuomo, because what he is willing to say, even though not on this stage, is to call me - the first Muslim on the precipice of leading this city - a terrorist sympathiser.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>Mamdani called Piker's statements \"objectionable and reprehensible\", and said that while he does recognise Israel's right to exist, he \"will not recognise any state's right to exist with a system of hierarchy on the basis of race or religion\".&nbsp;</p> <p>Cuomo, Mamdani added, would not understand the violation of international law that is the Israeli occupation, because he is part of the team assembled to defend the Israeli prime minister in the face of charges involving war crimes and crimes against humanity brought against him by the International Criminal Court (ICC).&nbsp;</p> <p>On the key sticking point stemming from US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-war-gaza\">Gaza</a>, Mamdani said he believes Hamas \"should lay down their arms\", but that \"calling for a ceasefire means... all parties have to cease fire and put down their weapons\".&nbsp;</p> <p>As was the case with the Democratic primary debate in June, the candidates were asked where they would go on their first foreign visit as mayor of New York City.</p> <p>Most, including Cuomo, said Israel. Mamdani said he would remain in the city because he would be focused on his constituents.&nbsp;</p> <p>That prompted the inevitable follow-up from moderators that seemed eager to know exactly where he stands: Would he visit Israel at all as mayor?</p> <p>\"You need not visit Israel to stand up for Jewish New Yorkers,\" Mamdani said. \"I'll be meeting them... in their synagogues and temples.\"</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Some one million Jews live in New York City.

I'm not going to send a lot of money to New York,\" Trump said earlier this week.</p> <p>A city as influential and as densely populated as New York City still requires federal funding, and those requests have to go through the White House. Trump, however, operates transactionally and bases his decisions on personal relationships.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"I know how to deal with Donald Trump because I've dealt with him before,\" Cuomo, who has known Trump for decades but also had his disagreements with him, said at the debate.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/zohran-mamdani-faces-racist-smears-calls-citizenship-stripped\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/2025_06_Mamdani_Michael%20M.%20Santiago_AFP.jpg.webp?itok=oqp4JQ_I\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Zohran Mamdani faces racist smears and calls for citizenship to be stripped</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/zohran-mamdani-faces-racist-smears-calls-citizenship-stripped\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>\"He has to know he's up against an adversary who can actually beat him\" when it comes to defending New York's liberal values, Cuomo added.</p> <p>\"I am the last person on this stage that Mr Trump wants to see as mayor, and that's why I should be the first choice for the people of the city,\" he said.</p> <p>Mamdani said that the title belongs to him.</p> <p>\"I am Donald Trump's worst nightmare as a progressive Muslim immigrant who actually fights for the things that I believe in, and the difference between myself and Andrew Cuomo is that my campaign is not funded by the very billionaires who put Donald Trump in DC.\"</p> <p>That said, \"Trump will target whomever is the next mayor of the city,\" Mamdani said.</p> <p>\"We saw that New Yorkers are being taken off the streets [by immigration officers] in their apartment building lobbies. We have $80m being taken off our city bank account. So I don't think there's any question that there's any mayor here that will be free from being attacked by Donald Trump.\"</p> <p>Cuomo, who repeatedly flubbed the pronunciation of Mamdani's name, said the assemblyman had no experience that could prepare him for the scope of the office. &nbsp;</p> <p>\"Mr Mamdani is very good on Twitter and with videos, but he actually produces nothing... Donald Trump would go through Mr Mamdani like a hot knife through butter. He's been in government 27 minutes. He passed three bills. That's all he's done. He has no experience with Washington.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>“What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity, and what you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience,\" Mamdani quipped.</p> <h3>Affordability</h3> <p>This is where Mamdani sees himself as a champion for a cause that has caused the greatest amount of strife in America, and by extension has led to a decline in health outcomes and an increase in violence, leading to the divisions we see today.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"We are live here in the most expensive city in the United States of America. One in four New Yorkers are living in poverty,\" he said at the debate.</p> <p>\"To make this city affordable, I will do so by freezing rent for more than two million rent-stabilised tenants, by making the slowest buses in the country fast and free, and by delivering universal childcare. And I will pay for this by taxing the one percent - &nbsp;the billionaires and the profitable corporations - that Mr Cuomo cares more about than working class New Yorkers\".&nbsp;</p> <p>That platform is what catapulted the Democratic Socialist to the top of the mayoral race, and simultaneously outraged New York City's <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/politics/elections/new-york-s-richest-ask-how-dare-he-as-mamdani-closes-in-on-city-hall/ar-AA1OD7wW\">wealthiest residents</a>.</p> <p>\"I think we have a management crisis... I think we have a fiscal crisis where the city is spending more than it is taking in, and I think we have a societal crisis where we have division and hate. Unaffordability? Raise the minimum wage, put more money in people's pockets... [and] build more affordable housing,\" Cuomo said of his approach.&nbsp;</p> <p>The average dwelling for a single individual in Manhattan - the most expensive of the city's five boroughs - now exceeds $4,500 a month, and the US is still grappling with levels of inflation that have only slightly cooled since the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Mamdani described being in his first year in the state legislature, when Cuomo was governor and refused to raise taxes on billionaires and corporations.</p> <p>\"I have experience in this... we actually overcame his objections, raised $4b in new annual revenue, and finally funded the very public schools that he had starved for so many years,\" Mamdani said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"If you think that the problem in this city is that my rent is too low, vote for him. If you know the problem in this city is that your rent is too high, vote for me\".&nbsp;</p> <p>The general election to decide New York City's next mayor is on 4 November.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/us-politics\" hreflang=\"en\">US Politics</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

Meanwhile, Centcom, which oversees US command in the Middle East, has become more focused in recent days on the ceasefire, suggesting it could play a bigger role.</p> <p>However, experts say US President Donald Trump is unlikely to send troops into Gaza, even as observers.</p> <p>“The US will not be the enforcer of last resort that some of these countries would like it to be,” Michael O’Hanlon, a defence expert at the Brookings Institution, told MEE.</p> <h3>UN Security Council Mandate?</h3> <p>To not be seen as an agent of Israel’s occupation, Egypt is also pressing for the stabilisation force to have a UN Security Council mandate. Arab and western diplomats who spoke with MEE say they believe a mandate is achievable.</p> <p>“China and Russia have veto power, but the fact that so many Arab and Muslim countries want a UN stamp of approval makes it unlikely they decide to act as spoilers,” one western diplomat in the region told MEE.</p> <blockquote> <p>'To be seen as legitimate by the Palestinians, it must not be perceived as contracted by Israel'</p> <p><em>- Jean Marie Guehenno, former UN under-secretary general for peacekeeping operations</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Some peacekeeping operations are run explicitly by the UN. The forces participating in them are nicknamed the “blue helmets” -&nbsp; in a nod to the international organisation’s colour.</p> <p>UN peacekeepers operated in Bosnia in the early 1990s, in Mali in the 2000s, and are currently in southern Lebanon.</p> <p>The International Stabilisation Force deploying to Gaza would be similar to the one operating in Haiti. The force combating armed groups there is Kenyan-led and US-supported. Although it has a UN Security Council mandate, its command and control do not report to the UN secretary general.</p> <p>The Nato-led forces that operated in Afghanistan after the US invasion also had a UN Security Council mandate.</p> <p>Although the US is pushing for the force, Trump has signalled he expects the Gulf States to pay for Gaza’s reconstruction and recovery. Peacekeepers will need to be paid, provisioned and armed.</p> <p>The cost of Unifil’s 10,000-strong peacekeeping mission is around $500m a year, according to the UN, and that doesn’t include the national support funds that member states spend.</p> <h3>'Ten times more difficult'</h3> <p>Deploying a full-fledged UN peacekeeping force can take anywhere from 6 months to one year, whereas international forces with a UN mandate can deploy much quicker.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>A classic example is East Timor, where Australian troops deployed after the country voted for independence from Indonesia in 1999.

A competent, strong country that was willing to mobilise and go in fast,” said Martin, who is the author of <i>All Necessary Measures? The United Nations and International Intervention in Libya. </i></p> <p><i>“</i>But the differences between Gaza and East Timor are tremendous. If it was difficult in East Timor, it will be ten times more difficult here,” he said, warning against comparisons between the two.</p> <p>Libya itself holds a lesson for the peacekeeping force. Soldiers never deployed to the North African country, but a 2011 UN Security Council resolution that authorised a Nato no-fly zone to protect civilians snowballed into a regime change campaign against&nbsp;Muammar Gaddafi.</p> <p>The risk for any Arab force in Gaza is that it becomes something like the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, which, in the view of locals, is overseeing an Israeli occupation.&nbsp;</p> <p>One key challenge is that the main external power pushing for a peacekeeping force, the US, is not viewed by Palestinians, or even Muslim and Arab states, as a neutral broker but a partner of Israel, which continues to occupy more than half of Gaza.</p> <h3>Will Hamas coexist with peacekeepers?</h3> <p>Gaza’s future governance is also up for grabs.</p> <p>Trump’s 20-point plan for the enclave says Hamas will have no role in the future government. It also calls for the group’s disarmament. But Hamas displayed its staying power this week after its security forces deployed with fresh uniforms and vehicles, hunting down what they said were “gangs” and Israeli collaborators.</p> <p>Hamas has governed Gaza since 2007.

Trump’s plan calls for a committee of Palestinian technocrats to govern Gaza, overseen by a so-called \"board of peace\" chaired by Trump.</p> <p>“You can’t just have a security force. You need a credible civil administration. They need to be crafted together,” a former senior UN official told MEE.</p> <p>O’Hanlon, at the Brookings Institution, told MEE that he believes Arab and Muslim states could lean on Hamas to accept peacekeepers. Turkey, Qatar and Egypt helped convince the group to accept Trump’s ceasefire.</p> <p>“Hamas might do better if it learns how to coexist with the mission. I don’t think Hamas would want to drive out an Arab peacekeeping force and create an opening for Israel to come back in,” he said. “The Arab peacekeeping force might be pretty charitable in how they define a Hamas fighter.”</p> <p>“What you can realistically hope is that the Arab peacekeeping force will keep a lid on things. It boils down to a new Palestinian leadership creating a force powerful enough that Hamas decides to put down its weapons,” he said.</p> <p>In that case, the force might be similar to Unifil in southern Lebanon. The force has operated on the ground there for decades, balancing between Hezbollah fighters on the ground and Israel. Hezbollah only began pulling its weapons from southern Lebanon in a meaningful way after signing a bruising ceasefire with Israel last year.</p> <p>Of course, that has been one of the long-running sources of friction between Israel and Unifil. If the peacekeeping force tries to accommodate Hamas, that could provoke a furious Israeli response.</p> <p>“They will be caught between a rock and a hard place,” Guehenno said.</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
