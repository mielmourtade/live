Thirty-seven members of the extended family: killed.&nbsp;</p> <p>But it is the fate of his cousin Haitham that now haunts the Salem family.</p> <p>In November 2024, Haitham Salem was arrested.

By 20 November 2024, the UN was reporting that for 40 days, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3ypxd3p4eo\">“virtually no aid”</a> had reached north Gaza.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>“Tanks were approaching our area, and there were strikes everywhere around us, so we decided to leave,” Alaa, 38, told Middle East Eye.</p> <p>“Israeli drones dropped leaflets ordering us to move toward ‘al-Sheikh Zayed square’. When we arrived there, they separated women and children from men, allowing women and children to continue on their way, while the men were detained in al-Kuwait school,” he said.</p> <blockquote> <p>'Are my kids alive? They’re dead… I swear they are dead'</p> <p>- <em>Haitham Salem</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Alaa was with Haitham and his brother Mohammed, as well as other cousins and men from the wider Salem family. &nbsp;</p> <p>“After hours of humiliation and inspection, they [the Israelis] made us walk past cameras and tanks. Soldiers would call out the names of those they wanted to arrest.</p> <p>\"They called Haitham and his brother Mohammed, arresting them along with several other men. I was not detained, so they let us go,” Alaa said.</p> <p>When, towards the end of January, the ceasefire deal signed by Hamas and Israel before the inauguration of US President Donald Trump came into effect, Alaa and his <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestinians-north-gaza-return-home-rubble-and-destruction\">family returned home</a>. They didn’t know where Haitham or his brother were and had been told nothing about them.</p> <p>“After a while, Mohammed was released,” Alaa said. “When he came out, he told us Haitham was alive and well, but they had no knowledge of what was happening outside - Mohammed didn’t even know that many family members had been killed, or that our home had been completely destroyed.”</p> <h3>Death and detention</h3> <p>Haitham worked as an electrical engineer at Beit Lahia municipality in northern Gaza and was not affiliated to any political group.</p> <p>While he was detained, Haitham’s wife Intisar and their children lived with Alaa and other family members. “They were enduring starvation and great fear in his absence. She was constantly anxious about him. Even after Mohammed told her Haitham was fine, she remained worried,” Alaa said.</p> <blockquote> <p>'When we reached him, he had fainted, but we managed to catch him in time, and he was given sedatives. He was in a terrible state - crying, trembling, unable to stand'</p> <p>- <em>Alaa Salem, Haitham's cousin</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Three weeks and four days before the ceasefire deal signed on 9 October, Israeli forces bombed the tent where Intisar and her children were sheltering in the al-Nasr area of Gaza.</p> <p>Both of Haitham’s daughters, aged two and five, were killed instantly. His son, Baraa, aged eight, was only lightly wounded in the strikes. But he was poisoned by shrapnel fragments and later died. Intisar, severely wounded in the attack, died of her injuries a few days later.</p> <p>“On the day of Haitham’s release, I went to Nasser Hospital to welcome him,” Alaa told MEE.&nbsp;“I was among the first to arrive, along with my brothers, Haitham’s father, and his brother.</p> <p>\"We arrived around 9am and waited. When the buses arrived, I started searching for Haitham and two of my cousins who were also detained,” he continued.&nbsp;</p> <p>“But I was especially looking for Haitham. I didn’t want anyone to find him before me. I wanted to be the one to tell him what had happened, because I knew he wouldn’t be able to handle the news from anyone else. I knew only I could calm him down and help him bear it.”</p> <p>As Alaa was looking for his cousin, someone tapped him on the shoulder and told him Haitham was calling for him. From behind the glass, Haitham was motioning to his cousin, asking where his children and wife were.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I gestured with my hands as if praying, to tell him they had gone to God,” Alaa said. “Are you serious?” Haitham replied. “I need you to be strong, like I’ve always known you to be,” Alaa told his cousin.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I rushed to coordinate with the Red Cross to bring him out of the bus. We brought a wheelchair for him,” Alaa told MEE. “When we reached him, he had fainted, but we managed to catch him in time, and he was given sedatives. He was in a terrible state - crying, trembling, unable to stand.”</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>In video footage seen by Middle East Eye, Haitham falls to the ground, clutches his stomach in pain, rocks back and forth, falls against a couple of plastic chairs, his legs shaking.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"url-embed-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Freed prisoner Haitham Salem broke down in tears upon his release after learning that Israel had killed his wife and all three of his children weeks before his release. <a href=\"https://t.co/1cKuYoUwbl\">pic.twitter.com/1cKuYoUwbl</a></p>— Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiddleEastEye/status/1977834553076048301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote> </div> <p>Holding a phone, he asks: “Are my kids alive?

Under the intensity of torture, he falsely confessed that Haitham worked as an electrical engineer for Hamas.”</p> <p>As a result, Alaa said, Haitham was brutally tortured himself for two weeks. “They unleashed police dogs on him, placed him in solitary confinement for a week, and gave him barely any food - just a spoon of strawberry jam or half an egg a day,” Alaa said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now Haitham Salem, a <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestinian</a> electrical engineer, has returned to a Gaza that has been almost totally destroyed, a Gaza without his wife or children.&nbsp;</p> <p>Released from Israeli detention, tears in his eyes, his body wracked with pain, he cried out. “My wife, I can’t find her… My beloved boy, every night I see you in my dreams.”</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\">Gaza City, occupied Palestine</div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

Its people carry on not out of defiance alone, but out of an unyielding belief that dignity is non-negotiable.</p> <p>This war has also reshaped global consciousness. For the first time in decades, the Palestinian narrative has overtaken Israel’s in the international arena.&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>The machinery of Israeli propaganda, once able to dictate western perception, has faltered in the face of overwhelming evidence. The world has seen, in real time, the killing of families, the destruction of hospitals, and the deliberate starvation of civilians.&nbsp;</p> <p>No amount of public relations could conceal that. From New York to London, Paris to Johannesburg, millions have taken to the streets demanding justice for Palestine. University encampments, once unthinkable in the West, have become enduring symbols of moral resistance.</p> <h3>Moral standing lost</h3> <p>Ironically, the war Israel launched to restore its deterrence has shattered its image. It has emerged not as a regional power to be feared, but as a morally bankrupt state sustained by impunity.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>Israel today is not merely a state that failed to achieve its military aims; it is a project in deep crisis -&nbsp; politically, socially and economically</p> </blockquote> <p>The resistance it sought to erase has instead become a universal emblem of persistence and faith. Gaza, far from being broken, has redefined the meaning of resilience itself.&nbsp;</p> <p>Israel today is not merely a state that failed to achieve its military aims; it is a project in deep crisis -&nbsp; politically, socially and economically.&nbsp;</p> <p>A state haunted by fear, judged by the world and increasingly alienated even from its own supporters. It has lost something far greater than soldiers or weapons: it has lost its moral standing, its narrative control and its sense of purpose.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gaza, by contrast, has lost its buildings, but not its soul.</p> <p>It remains what it has long been - a wound that exposes hypocrisy, a symbol that redefines steadfastness. It did not win because the world abandoned it, but it did not break because its faith in justice is stronger than destruction.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Gaza, victory is not measured by rockets fired but by the mothers who rise from the ruins, the children who keep learning in the dark, and the people who still believe that what is bombed cannot be erased, and what is besieged cannot die.</p> <p>Israel did not win because it has lost its humanity. Gaza did not break because it still clings to the root of life itself. The war may be over, but the greater struggle - the struggle for conscience, truth and justice - has only just begun.&nbsp;</p> <p>In that moral reckoning, Gaza has already prevailed.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/gaza-extermination\" hreflang=\"en\">Gaza extermination</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

afternoon whether he accepted that there was no possible interpretation of \"internationalise the intifada\" other than as \"a call to attack Jewish communities around the world\".</p> <p>Lewis seemed to be referring to the popular chant \"globalise the intifada\", often used at pro-Palestine protests.&nbsp;</p> <p>Starmer replied: \"There's&nbsp;no other interpretation.\" He added that he was glad

A previous incident involved a single flag placed above a St George's Cross, which generated significant backlash and online attention.</p> <p>In both cases, residents felt action from local authorities was insufficient.</p> <p>Prior to that, St George's Crosses had been put up illegally along the same stretch. Council officers tasked with removing them were, according to Smith, \"abused and threatened,\" leaving authorities in what he described as \"a stalemate\".</p> <p>This time, however, the display of Israeli flags was far larger, covering one of the town's most visible public spaces and prompting residents to act first, without waiting for police or council officers to intervene.</p> <p>\"The town was definitely displeased with the flags being up there,\" Smith said. \"It built into a bigger issue the longer the day went on. They weren't council approved.

She said that in other parts of the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk\">UK</a> she had experienced Islamophobic abuse for wearing her hijab, but Hastings had felt different. The town offered a community she described as kind and supportive.</p> <p>\"That flag, for me, is on jeeps, checkpoints, places where I was terrified,\" she said. Seeing the flag flying over her new home - the place she’d described as a \"happy bubble\" - felt like an intrusion.</p> <blockquote> <p>'It really felt like a deliberate tactic to agitate local people and initiate propaganda'</p> <p><em>- Krissie Nicholson, Hastings resident</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Later that day, <a href=\"https://x.com/SussexFOI/status/1975515671921414543\">Sussex Friends of Israel</a> claimed responsibility for the stunt on social media. Stewart Ide, a local man, also gave an interview to GB News, acknowledging that he organised the display.</p> <p>MEE reached out to Ide for comment but did not receive a response by time of publication.</p> <p>Later, MEE encountered Ide at a Sukkot event organised by Hastings Jews for Justice. He had not been invited but attended, confronting community members directly.&nbsp;</p> <p>When asked about his motivations for putting up the flags, Ide said: \"Two years ago there was a lot of people murdered.\"</p> <p>When pressed on whether he had sought council approval, he walked away without answering.&nbsp;</p> <h3>One guy with a ladder'</h3> <p>For many in Hastings, a town with a long history of sanctuary and community organising, the stunt was less a show of solidarity with Israeli civilians than a deliberate provocation.</p> <p>\"It really felt like a deliberate tactic to agitate local people and initiate propaganda,\" said Krissie Nicholson, a local community organiser who runs the Safe Havens initiative.</p> <p>\"I find it deeply saddening that a crisis on the scale of what’s happening in the Gaza is being used this way for political gain.\"</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/mosque-firebombed-attackers-sussex-while-people-inside-leaving-community-shock\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/peacehaven%20attack%20forensics%20CROP.jpg.webp?itok=D08Dz7j1\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Mosque firebombed in Sussex with people inside, leaving community in shock</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/mosque-firebombed-attackers-sussex-while-people-inside-leaving-community-shock\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Nicholson said the display was entirely out of step with life on the ground, where interfaith events and local solidarity networks are woven into the fabric of the town.</p> <p>\"People from different backgrounds, including Muslim people, Jewish people, people of no faith, want to come together and learn from each other,\" she said. \"This is not going to divide us - it's going to make the community stronger.\"</p> <p>Members of the town's Jewish community echoed that sentiment.</p> <p>Katy Colley, from Hastings Jews for Justice, said the stunt was the work of a tiny number of people seeking to provoke a reaction, rather than a reflection of the wider community.</p> <p>\"It's a very small number of people aggressively targeting our town because of our amazing solidarity with Palestine,” she said.</p> <p>\"When the council formalised the town's friendship link with Al Mawasi in Gaza, that's when this aggravation started. The reality is that this was literally the action of one guy with a ladder. It's obnoxious, it’s bullying, and it doesn't reflect the broader community.\"</p> <p>Colley emphasised that the stunt was being used by its organisers to conflate Jewish identity with support for the Israeli state, a link that Hastings’ Jewish community rejects.</p> <p>\"We're here to say Israel does not represent us, does not speak for us,\" she said. \"It certainly is not committing atrocities in our name.\"</p> <p></p> <p>For other residents, the incident was another reminder of rising nationalism hitting Britain's streets.</p> <p>\"There's so much inflammatory stuff going on with flags,\" said Robert, a local resident.</p> <p>\"I'd rather not see them at all,\" he added.</p> <p>Similar debates have played out in other UK towns over the past few months, but Hastings’ reputation as a sanctuary town made the stunt stand out.&nbsp;</p> <p>For years, the borough has nurtured refugee support networks, interfaith coalitions, and community events. It is also a dispersal area and a key landing point for small boat crossings from the English Channel.</p> <p>For Hastings, the battle isn't about fabric hanging from poles.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Our community is much stronger than any sort of fantasy far-right attempts to divide it,\" said Smith. \"The act doesn't reflect the identity of the town, and it undermines a lot of the community cohesion work we do.\"</p> <p>\"We are peace-loving people,\" Nicholson said. \"We're a diverse community.

senior human rights official has urged the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk\">British</a> government to review its protest laws over the recent proscription of Palestine Action as a terror organisation.</p> <p>Michael O'Flaherty,&nbsp;the Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, said in a <a href=\"https://rm.coe.int/letter-to-the-home-secretary-of-united-kingdom-by-michael-o-flaherty-c/488028b2a8\">letter</a> to British Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood that the UK's legal framework allows authorities to \"impose excessive limits on freedom of assembly and expression, and risk overpolicing\".</p> <p>His intervention comes after Middle East Eye <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/revealed-more-charged-palestine-action-ban-entire-war-terror\">revealed</a> last month that four times as many people had been charged in the&nbsp;<a

on terror\" since 2001.</p> <p>Hundreds have been arrested at protests against the proscription for holding placards reading: \"I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action\".</p> <p>Supporting the group is now a criminal offence, as is inviting or \"recklessly\" expressing \"support for the group\".</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense

the law.</p> <p>Under current legislation, anything that is construed as justifying Palestine Action's methods or ideology can be grounds for arrest.</p> <h3>'Comprehensive review'</h3> <p>O'Flaherty wrote in the letter to Mahmood, sent last month but reported by the <a

designed to counter ‘terrorism’ or ‘violent extremism’ must not impose any limitations on fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, that are not strictly

the policing of protests with the United Kingdom’s human rights obligations be undertaken\".</p> <p>This comes as the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has published a <a
