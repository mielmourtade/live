It promises that Israel will not annex Gaza, and gestures toward a future pathway to realising Palestinian self-determination.</p> <p>While the 36 UN experts welcomed certain elements, such as a permanent ceasefire, humanitarian aid under UN supervision, the release of unlawfully detained persons, and commitments against forced displacement and annexation, they stressed that these measures are already required under international law and should not depend on the success of a peace plan.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>“Imposing an immediate peace at any price, regardless of, or brazenly against law and justice, is a recipe for further injustice, future violence and instability,” they said.</p> <p>The experts identified a wide range of concerns, raising questions about the plan’s compatibility with international law and with the International Court of Justice’s 2024 Advisory Opinion, which affirmed that Israel’s presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful and must end unconditionally.</p> <p>Below are the 15 reasons the UN experts condemned Trump's proposal.</p> <h3>1. Self-determination made conditional</h3> <p>The experts said the plan fails to guarantee Palestinians their right to self-determination, including through independent statehood.</p> <p>Instead, statehood is made contingent on factors such as Gaza’s redevelopment, reform of the PA, and dialogue between Israel and Palestine.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>They warned that this places Palestine’s political future in the hands of outside actors, despite the ICJ’s finding that self-determination cannot be conditioned on negotiations.</p> <h3>2. Lack of representative governance</h3> <p>The plan proposes a “temporary transitional government” for Gaza. According to the experts, this body would not be representative of Palestinians, excludes the PA, and lacks legitimacy. No clear benchmarks or timeframes are set for transitioning to representative Palestinian governance.</p> <h3>3. Oversight outside UN authority</h3> <p>Oversight of the plan is assigned to a “Board of Peace” chaired by the US president.</p> <p>The experts criticised this arrangement as lacking transparency, bypassing UN authority, and placing control in the hands of a state that is a close ally of Israel.</p> <p>They warned that this model is reminiscent of colonial governance practices and is inconsistent with international law’s demand for multilateral oversight.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <h3>4. Replacement of occupation with foreign control</h3> <p>The proposal includes an “International Stabilisation Force” to be deployed in Gaza.</p> <p>The experts said this would amount to a foreign or US-led occupation, rather than restoring Palestinian sovereignty, and is an infringement of Palestinian self-determination. They emphasised that Israel’s occupation must end “immediately, totally and unconditionally”.</p> <h3>5. Continuing Israeli presence</h3> <p>The plan allows Israel to maintain a “security perimeter” inside Gaza’s borders. The experts described this as a continuation of occupation by other means and therefore unacceptable under international law.</p> <h3>6. Demilitarisation without reciprocity</h3> <p>Gaza is required to undergo indefinite demilitarisation, with no specified end date. The experts warned that if permanent, this would leave Gaza vulnerable to attack. No parallel obligations are imposed on Israel, which retains extensive military capacity and has carried out repeated operations in Gaza.</p> <h3>7. Unequal deradicalisation measures</h3> <p>The plan imposes “deradicalisation” on Gaza but does not address anti-Palestinian or anti-Arab rhetoric in Israel. The experts noted that incitement to violence and even genocide has been prominent in Israeli discourse over the past two years, but this is not addressed.</p> <h3>8. Fragmentation of Palestinian territory</h3> <p>The proposal treats Gaza in isolation and does not integrate it with the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The experts said this undermines the territorial unity of Palestine, which is recognised in international law as a single territorial unit.</p> <h3>9. Economic exploitation risks</h3> <p>An “economic development plan” and the creation of a “special economic zone” could result in foreign exploitation of Gaza’s resources without Palestinian consent. The experts warned that such measures could perpetuate economic dependency rather than support sovereignty.</p> <h3>10. Absence of reparations</h3> <p>The plan contains no requirement for Israel or supporting states to compensate Palestinians for destruction caused by military operations. International law requires reparations for unlawful damage caused by violations.</p> <h3>11. Unequal treatment of detainees</h3> <p>The plan provides for the release of all Israeli captives but only some Palestinian detainees, many of whom are arbitrarily detained. This imbalance, the experts said, denies equal treatment under international law.</p> <h3>12. Amnesty without accountability</h3> <p>Hamas members are offered amnesties regardless of whether they committed international crimes. The experts warned that such unconditional amnesties deny justice for victims of serious violations.</p> <h3>13. No accountability for Israeli crimes</h3> <p>The plan does not address accountability for Israeli international crimes or human rights violations. Nor does it include mechanisms for transitional justice, truth-telling, reconciliation, or guaranteed access for independent journalists. The experts said accountability is integral to any sustainable peace.</p> <h3>14. Omission of fundamental issues</h3> <p>The experts stressed that the plan does not tackle core issues identified by international law and past peace efforts, including:</p> <ul> <li>The dismantling of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem<br /> &nbsp;</li> <li>Establishment of recognised borders<br /> &nbsp;</li> <li>The right of return and status of Palestinian refugees<br /> &nbsp;</li> <li>The obligation of Israel to make reparations<br /> &nbsp;</li> </ul> <h3>15. Limited UN role</h3> <p>The plan sidelines the United Nations and its agencies, including the General Assembly, the Security Council, and Unrwa, which provides critical services to Palestinian refugees. The experts said this undermines the legitimacy of the process, as the ICJ identified the UN, not individual states, as the proper authority to oversee the end of the occupation.</p> <p>In their statement, the experts recalled that the ICJ had made clear that conditions cannot be placed on Palestinian self-determination and that occupation must end immediately and unconditionally.</p> <p>“Any peace plan must respect the ground rules of international law,” they said. “The future of Palestine must be in the hands of the Palestinian people- not imposed by outsiders under extreme conditions of duress in yet another scheme to control their destiny.”</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

He has explicitly adopted the framework that the Allied forces imposed on Germany: de-Nazification, demilitarisation and reconstruction of the economy after unconditional surrender.</p> <p>This framing serves a deliberate purpose of disguising the genocide of the indigenous Palestinian population as an international war against \"terrorism\".</p> <p>By equating resistance to foreign <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/occupation\">occupation</a> with Nazi state atrocities, Israel seeks to provide a colonial alibi for its true objective in Gaza - the elimination of Palestinian political identity and aspirations for national liberation.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlNJ31p_ufE\">comparison</a> also seeks to elevate Israel's colonial goals into an international priority, offering legal and moral cover for its ongoing genocide by presenting Hamas as a regime as irredeemable as the Third Reich.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>But the invocation of World War Two has not been confined to Israel's propaganda war. Just as the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">United States</a>, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk\">Great Britain</a> and the Soviet Union determined Germany's future at the Potsdam Conference in 1945, US President <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/trump\">Donald Trump</a> and Netanyahu's <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/www.middleeasteye.net/news/full-text-trumps-20-point-plan-end-war-gaza-0\">20-point plan</a> now seeks to dictate the fate of the Palestinian cause.</p> <h3>War model</h3> <p>The Trump plan unveiled this week builds directly on Netanyahu's prerequisites as a framework for erasing Palestinian claims to indigeneity.</p> <p>Whereas Nazi Germany was an aggressor state, Palestinians are a colonised population fighting for their physical and political survival. The proposal, therefore, empowers Israel as an occupying state to carry out its \"final solution\" against Palestinians and dismantle their political identity with total impunity.</p> <blockquote> <p>This racist idea of developing a 'new Palestinian breed' reveals the coloniser’s aim to eliminate and replace the colonised, forcing them to accept their oppressor's superiority</p> </blockquote> <p>In his July 2024 <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/false-claims-benjamin-netanyahu-made-his-address-congress\">address</a> to the US Congress, Netanyahu emphasised the importance of demilitarisation and de-radicalisation for creating a \"new generation of Palestinians\" who would not \"hate Jews\" and could live in \"peace\" with Israel.</p> <p>He held up post-war Germany and Japan as successful models of defeated populations reshaped into stability after unconditional surrender, leading to \"decades of peace, prosperity, and security\".</p> <p>This racist idea of developing a \"<a href=\"https://stabilityjournal.org/articles/10.5334/sta.gi\">new Palestinian breed</a>\", first invoked by US Army General Keith Dayton during his early-2000s project to restructure security forces in the West Bank, reveals the US and Israel's longstanding objectives: an attempt by the coloniser to eliminate and replace the colonised and appropriate their land by forcing them to accept the superiority of their oppressor.</p> <p>Despite Netanyahu's insistence on likening Palestinians to Nazis and portraying Gaza as post-war Germany, the reality remains that Israel, as a settler-colonial project, treats Palestinians as natives who must be eliminated, either through genocide or subjugation, to make space for the new state.</p> <h3>De-Hamasification</h3> <p>The three \"prerequisites for peace\", while echoing the de-Nazification programme for propaganda purposes, serve Israel's ongoing project of settler-colonialism.</p> <p>De-radicalisation means the violent social engineering of Palestinians to give up their claims to the land and their rights to self-determination and sovereignty, following the footsteps of the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/palestine-state\">Palestinian Authority</a> in becoming native informants to the colonisers.</p> <p>Unlike classic colonialism, which seeks to exploit native labour and resources, settler-colonialism destroys the native's reality in order to replace it with another. Israel will never feel \"safe\" unless Palestinian national identity is destroyed.</p> <hr /> <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/israel-rejects-hamas-truce-offer-thousands-forced-flee-gaza-city\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of Israel's genocide in Gaza</i></b></a></p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <hr /> <p>For this reason, Israel has always viewed any assertion, whether cultural or political, of Palestinian claims as radicalism that must be uprooted.</p> <p>\"De-Hamasification\" takes this strategy further, forcing Palestinians to capitulate to the coloniser's imposed reality without any resistance.</p> <p>While the language of \"radical Islam\" and \"terrorism\" helps Israel <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-islamophobia-and-anti-palestinian-racism-were-born-together\">justify</a> its crimes, \"de-Hamasification\" signals the need for deeper societal and cultural changes that go beyond crushing armed resistance.</p> <p>It requires the violent rejection of Palestinian <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-prove-israel-isnt-settler-colony-even-it-pursues-greater-israel\">indigeneity</a>, which underpins the right to physically resist occupation in pursuit of liberation.</p> <p class=\"text-align-center\"></p> <p>Since the inception of the Zionist movement, its leaders have invoked western colonial, racist and orientalist rhetoric to justify the need for Israel as an \"outpost of civilisation\" against \"barbarism\".</p> <p>In the past two years, Israeli leaders have utilised this same <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-gaza-social-media-account-no-innocent-civilians\">racist rhetoric</a> against Palestinians to muster western support and justify genocide in Gaza. As recently as Netanyahu's speech at the UN General Assembly, he reiterated that Israel is protecting the West from \"radical Islam\".</p> <p>This racist and supremacist rhetoric is not incidental, but rather a consubstantial part of Zionist settler-colonialism. Racial hierarchy is needed to justify the colonisation of the land and the subjugation and extermination of its indigenous population.</p> <p>Without crystallising the supposed cultural and moral inferiority of Palestinians, ethnic cleansing could not be legitimised as a necessary step towards the creation of a \"civilised\" nation like Israel.</p> <h3>Colonial continuity</h3> <p>Israel's racial hierarchy was invoked at the most recent Trump-Netanyahu summit, which delved into the details of the 20-point proposal without any empathy for Palestinian suffering or recognition of their political aspirations.</p> <p>They both talked about Palestinians as sidenotes to Israeli priorities, limiting their wishes to policies that centred on Israeli security.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>The key components of the proposal, whether permanent military and security control, total demilitarisation, cultural de-radicalisation or a non-sovereign Palestinian civil administration controlled by western powers, are all designed to erase any political rights for the indigenous population.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/why-trump-blair-gaza-plan-is-unlawful\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/uk-blair-speaks-new-york-september-2022-john-lamparski-getty-images-afp.jpg.webp?itok=B9GvpuaB\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Why the Trump-Blair Gaza plan is unlawful</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/why-trump-blair-gaza-plan-is-unlawful\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>In essence, Trump's 20-point proposal can be considered the 21st-century version of the 1917 <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/balfour-declaration-study-british-duplicity\">Balfour Declaration</a>. Trump's words and tone were hardly distinguishable from Arthur Balfour's reference to Palestinians as \"non-Jewish communities\", relegating them from the owners of the land to mere minorities with no political rights or human dignity.</p> <p>Reflecting on his Declaration in 1919, the British statesman <a href=\"https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/behind-balfour/index.html\">undermined</a> the will and rights of Palestinians by saying that Zionism, whether \"right or wrong, good or bad\", was more important to the British Empire than the desires of the Palestinian people. As a result, the Zionist movement embarked on an ethnic cleansing campaign against the indigenous people of Palestine in order to establish their state in 1948.</p> <p>Today, Trump's \"new vision for peace\" resembles yet another western colonial intervention to keep Israel as a regional hegemon in order to maintain western political and economic control in the Middle East.</p> <p>Consequently, Israel will continue its agenda of eliminating Palestinians by <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/gaza-extermination\">mass murdering </a>them, curbing their ability to resist, and erasing their national identity, history, culture, civilisation and dignity.</p> <p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

A bomb hit Dawoud’s tent, killing him, his daughter, and several other Palestinians.</p> <p>“Sami was deeply committed to keeping his wife and children safe and as comfortable as possible wherever they stayed,” his friend and colleague, photographer Yahya Barzaq, told Middle East Eye.</p> <p>“He was extremely protective of his family, especially since his wife could not bear fear. He was always keen to make sure she felt at ease,” Barzaq added.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>“He always cared for his children deeply, paying attention to their clothes, education, cleanliness, and upbringing.”</p> <p>In mid-August, Israel launched the first phase of a major offensive aimed at taking control of Gaza City ahead of a full occupation of the Strip.</p> <blockquote> <p>'He was extremely protective of his family'</p> <p><em>-&nbsp;Yahya Barzaq, Palestinian&nbsp;photographer</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This marked a major escalation in its military strategy, shifting from months of targeted air strikes to a full-scale ground invasion.</p> <p>By mid-September, the Israeli military had further intensified air strikes. It issued fresh mass displacement orders to over a million residents in Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip, instructing them to flee south.</p> <p>Under relentless bombardment and with no safe refuge remaining in the north, hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee.</p> <p>But many, like Dawoud, were killed in the very places they had fled to - where the bombing had been no less severe.</p> <p>Since 11 August, Israel has killed 1,903 Palestinians in central and southern Gaza - representing 46 percent of the total death toll in the Gaza Strip during this period, according to the Gaza-based Government Media Office.</p> <h3>‘Unimagined brutality’</h3> <p>Originally a resident of the Shujaiya neighbourhood east of Gaza City, Dawoud was displaced multiple times since the beginning of Israel’s genocide in Gaza in October 2023.</p> <p>However, following the ceasefire agreement in January, he returned home. Around a month later, he was forced out again after Israel broke the agreement, resuming the attacks on the blockaded enclave.</p> <p>Initially, Dawoud resisted advice from friends, including Barzaq, to flee again.&nbsp;</p> <p>But a day later, he sent them a message on a group chat saying that he had to flee with his family under fire and could not take anything from the house.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>“We all started laughing and told him, ‘Weren’t you acting like a hero saying you would stay?” Barzaq recalled.</p> <p>“He replied that he had never imagined the level of fear and brutality he and his family experienced. From that day on, Sami was determined never to expose his family to such danger again.”</p> <figure class=\"align-center media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"(X)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"(X)\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/G1or3siWsAAaFJo.jpg\" width=\"2000\" /> </div> <figcaption>Sami Dawoud was killed with his daughter Ghena in an air strike on their tent in Deri al-Balah (X)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p>After fleeing, he turned to Barzaq for help in finding shelter.&nbsp;</p> <p>Barzaq told him about a seven-storey building in Gaza City, badly damaged - half of it destroyed and the other half leaning precariously - but still housing displaced families who considered it safer than tents.&nbsp;</p> <p>One flat remained unoccupied, which Dawoud accepted.

It shakes a lot with every bombing, and the children are terrified,” Barzaq told MEE.</p> <p>“So he moved to another apartment [in the central Gaza City].”</p> <h3>Fleeing from death to death</h3> <p>Eventually, Dawoud decided to flee Gaza City altogether. When he arrived in the central Gaza Strip last month, he contacted Barzaq once more.</p> <p>“Help me. I’ve arrived, but I’m on the street,” he messaged.</p> <p>Barzaq put out a public appeal online asking if anyone in Deir al-Balah could host Dawoud and his family, even for one night. But there were no responses.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/final-goodbye-mee-reporters-pain-being-forced-out-gaza\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Gaza-Palestinians-inspect-destruction-bank-24-September-2025-Reuters.jpg.webp?itok=8yOOB80w\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Final goodbye: MEE reporters on the pain of being forced out of Gaza City</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/final-goodbye-mee-reporters-pain-being-forced-out-gaza\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>“That night, he practically slept in the open,” Barzaq said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The following day, after an extensive search, he found an empty plot of land where he pitched a tent.&nbsp;</p> <p>He told Barzaq he was relieved, believing the area to be safe because there were no other people nearby.</p> <p>Roughly a week later, an Israeli air strike targeted the tent. Dawoud was killed, along with his eldest daughter, Ghena. His wife and middle daughter were wounded.</p> <p>Dawoud’s death sparked outrage and shock through Gaza’s journalist community, as his colleagues stressed that his work had not provoked the Israeli army.</p> <p>“We had worked together on an online educational channel whose goal was to turn the school curriculum into digital lessons during the coronavirus outbreak, when students and teachers had to rely on e-learning,” Barzaq said.</p> <p>“Sami was a cameraman and video editor. He was very skilled and professional in his work. What set him apart was that he worked quietly, with a very calm temperament. He was a man of morals, faith, and composure.”</p> <h3>Barzaq killed</h3> <p>A day after speaking to MEE on Monday, Barzaq was killed in an Israeli air strike on Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip.</p> <p>The strike hit an area near a coffee shop he had visited to upload the material he had photographed.</p> <blockquote> <p>'The incident in which he was killed was always present in his mind'</p> <p><em>-&nbsp;Mahmoud Abuhamda, Palestinian&nbsp;photographer</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Barzaq had fled from Gaza City to Deir al-Balah just two weeks earlier, according to his friend, photographer Mahmoud Abuhamda.</p> <p>“He was still setting up his tent,” Abuhamda said. “It wasn’t finished yet, but he couldn’t find another place to stay, so he set it up on a building rooftop in Deir al-Balah.”</p> <p>Like Dawoud, Barzaq had been desperately searching for a safe place to shelter his wife and two children before he was killed.</p> <p>Upon hearing the news of his death, Abuhamda rushed to the morgue at al-Aqsa Hospital to say goodbye to his friend.</p> <p>“I saw a spot of blood at the back of his head, and the blood was clotted, so I suspect it came from a shrapnel,” he said.</p> <p>“This is not the first time he has faced death. Last year, while shooting a story for TRT, a quadcopter hovered overhead and opened fire directly at him. He then hid in a tent and documented the incident.”</p> <figure class=\"align-center media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"(X)\" class=\"embedded-entity\"> <img alt=\"(X)\" height=\"1036\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/556425541_1369704964713512_2862711337432376279_n%20%281%29.jpg\" width=\"1840\" /> </div> <figcaption>Yahya Barzaq was a well-known newborn photographer in the Gaza Strip (X)</figcaption> </div> </figure> <p><span><img height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span></p> <p><span><img alt=\"alt\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\" /></span>Barzaq was widely known in Gaza as a newborn photographer, having conducted photo sessions for hundreds of babies across the Strip.</p> <p>In January, he shared a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEu49oDMnDi/?igsh=MTN0Y3htdjI0d2hu\">video</a> montage of newborns he had photographed - many of whom were later killed in Israeli attacks.</p> <p>“These are children who were photographed in my studio. I witnessed their sweet laughter and the love of their parents for them, and they were killed in the blink of an eye,” he wrote in the caption.</p> <p>“I want the war to end for everyone in general, and for the children in particular. I cannot bear to witness the suffering of the children, their crying, their fear, their screaming, and their hunger.”</p> <p>According to Abuhamda, Barzaq had a strong sense that he would be killed during the war.</p> <p>“He felt death was near. He always told me that he wished the war would stop because he could not guarantee surviving an air strike or shrapnel. The incident in which he was killed was always present in his mind,” he said.</p> <p>“He used to speak about the contradictions - how he would take photos of newborns who had just come to life, and now he was documenting death in Gaza.”</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\">Deir al-Balah, Gaza, occupied Palestine</div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
