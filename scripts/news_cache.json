It spread across social networks, group chats - everywhere.”</p> <p>For Bragg, the backlash revealed that dissent inside and outside the tech world has been brewing for years, pointing to the controversy around Sean Maguire, an investor at Sequoia Capital, who came under fire for his support of Israel’s war on Gaza.</p> <p>“It showed that the tech world actually does care, does have an opinion,” said Bragg.&nbsp;</p> <p>“For the last two years, we’ve seen Israel and its supporters weaponise accusations of antisemitism to silence conversation within companies and across social media. But those tactics aren’t working anymore. The Zionist investors are on the back foot.”</p> <h3>The roots of grassroots pressure</h3> <p>Central to the global calls for tech companies to divest from Israel is Tech Against Apartheid - a

campaigns against corporate power, believes workers have been key to driving change and conversations on the role big tech has played in Israel’s ongoing genocide.</p> <p>“No matter how much executives try to sweep this under the rug, the pressure building from within the company is becoming impossible to ignore,” Hammad told MEE.</p> <p>“In fact, the more the companies crack down on those speaking out, the more attention they’re bringing to their company’s involvement in facilitating war crimes and genocide.”</p> <p>During the course of the war in Gaza, Amazon, Google and Microsoft have unilaterally fired workers who have spoken out, subjected them to prolonged internal investigations and, on some occasions, even called the police on them for circulating petitions and holding vigils for Gaza.</p> <p>But amid the crackdown inside these global companies, workers have continued to find ways to resist their employers, as evidence mounts of the growing cooperation between Big Tech and Israel.&nbsp;</p> <p>For tech workers, these alliances have become a rallying point to take action and examples of how unregulated AI and surveillance technology feed directly into systems of occupation and apartheid.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"media-block\"> <div class=\"group-inner\"> <div alt=\"Microsoft workers have been campaigning against the company supplying cloud

width=\"15\" /></span>Before its decision to cut ties with Unit 8200, Microsoft released a <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/#:~:text=We%20have%20found%20no%20evidence%20to%20date,harm%20people%20in%20the%20conflict%20in%20Gaza.\">statement in August</a>, claiming that it “found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza\".</p> <p>Hammad argues that its decision to step back from Unit 8200 would not have happened without the persistence of workers inside Microsoft.</p> <p>“Microsoft’s quiet retreat from its Unit 8200 deal proves what workers and whistleblowers have said all along: the company was fuelling Israel’s war crimes,” said Hammad.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>'These companies are interconnected in their complicity, and so our struggles must be interconnected as well'</p> <p>-&nbsp;<em>Abdo Mohamed, a former Microsoft employee</em></p> </blockquote> <p>“It also shows executives understand the legal and material risks of their partnerships with Israel’s military. But this is no victory lap. Microsoft still holds other military contracts and nothing short of full divestment from Israel’s war machine will be a victory.”</p> <p>Hammad’s concerns are echoed by Abdo Mohamed, a former Microsoft employee, fired for his activism through the No Azure for Apartheid (NAA) campaign.</p> <p>He is confident that Microsoft’s decision to scale back its services with Israel’s Unit 8200 is as a “partial result” of pressure built through organising, advocacy and disruption, but says “it's far from enough\".</p> <p>“The moment Microsoft withdrew from some services, data was being transferred to Amazon Web services - another big tech company complicit [in the genocide] through Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government,” said Mohamed.</p> <p>“These companies are interconnected in their complicity, and so our struggles must be interconnected as well.”</p> <h3>Growth of alternatives&nbsp;</h3> <p>While workers continue to place internal pressure on companies, some are looking for alternative&nbsp;tools and companies not connected to Israel&nbsp;and a way out of the Big Tech firms.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Bragg pointed to a surge in alternative apps and platforms posted online following the backlash against Vercel’s chief executive.</p> <p>Adil Abbuthalha, who grew up in Silicon Valley, says his disillusionment with Big Tech long predated the genocide and believes these companies only cater to the “top 0.0001 percent of the world\".</p> <p>“This is the first live-streamed genocide. If the most powerful industry in the world can’t move with clarity, then it's up to us to build alternatives ourselves,” Abbuthalha told MEE.</p> <blockquote> <p>'This is the first live-streamed genocide. If the most powerful industry in the world can’t move with clarity, then it's up to us to build alternatives ourselves'</p> <p>-&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;Adil Abbuthalha, founder of Boycat&nbsp;</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Like Bragg, Abbuthalha saw a “unique moment when millions condemned Vercel’s CEO and immediately started building alternatives”.</p> <p>This conviction, coupled with the war in Gaza, led him to create Boycat, a platform that helps users identify and switch from companies complicit in Israeli war crimes.&nbsp;</p> <p>The app has been downloaded by approximately two million people with 10 million people viewing their posts on Instagram every month.</p> <p>Boycat has since expanded and begun developing alternative tools and platforms, including a VPN Abbuthalha describes as “clean technology” that is built independently of Israeli-linked firms and data centres.</p> <p>He describes his vision as an alternative “digital silk road” that connects developers and ethical tech projects worldwide to reduce dependence on Western and Israeli tech monopolies.</p> <p>He believes the emergence of new alternatives is part of a collective awakening as people working in the industry, like so many others, felt a feeling of helplessness as the death toll in Gaza grew day after day.</p> <p>“The genocide forced people to imagine a different kind of tech world,” said Abbuthalha.</p> <p>“Two years ago, we wouldn’t be having conversations about building clean, alternative technology.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Now everyone is talking about it - how to make sure the genocide never happens again.”</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",

His crimes included rape, murder and persecution.&nbsp;</p> <p>The conviction in the first and only trial looking at crimes in Sudan since the case was referred to the court by the United Nations Security Council in 2005.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Of course, 20 years too late is never satisfying, but I think considering we haven’t seen any kind of justice ever for any crime committed by any Sudanese government or government aligned person, this is a landmark case,” Kholood Khair, a Sudanese analyst and founder of the Confluence Advisory think tank, told Middle East Eye.</p> <p>A vast region in western Sudan, Darfur has been wracked by conflict for much of the 21st century. In 2003, local populations there, mostly non-Arab, took up arms against the Sudanese government of Omar al-Bashir, an autocrat who ruled from 1989 to 2019.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>Bashir’s government was accused by the Darfuris of marginalising and mistreating them. To crush this rebellion, which was led by the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement, the government deployed the mostly Arab Janjaweed militias.</p> <p>The fighters went on to kill hundreds of thousands of people in a wave of violence that the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">US </a>and human rights groups determined to be a genocide.</p> <p>Ali Kushayb, the “colonel of colonels” who came from an Arab tribe and operated in West Darfur, commanded thousands of Janjaweed militia as part of the Popular Defence Forces (PDF), an Islamist paramilitary aligned with Bashir’s National Congress Party.&nbsp;</p> <p>He was alleged to have implemented the government’s counter-insurgency strategy in Darfur and was seen as the mediator between Janjaweed leaders in Wadi Salih, West Darfur, and Bashir’s administration in the capital Khartoum.</p> <p>In 2020, Kushayb surrendered himself voluntarily to the ICC while in the Central African Republic. His arrest warrant was first issued in 2007. From his arrival at the ICC, Kushayb denied that he was the person who the court believed him to be.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <h3>'Don’t leave anyone behind'</h3> <p>Joanna Korner, the presiding judge at the ICC, said Ali Kushayb had been found guilty of all crimes he had been charged with and dismissed his defence that he was the victim of mistaken identity.&nbsp;</p> <p>“He encouraged and gave instructions that resulted in the killings, the rapes and destruction committed by the Janjaweed,” she said.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>'He encouraged and gave instructions that resulted in the killings, the rapes and destruction committed by the Janjaweed'</p> <p>- <em>Joanna Korner, judge</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Korner described Kushayb as someone who was clearly a “person of some renown, highly respected” before the war in Darfur began. But she said that the commander had given orders to “wipe out and sweep away” non-Arab tribes and told soldiers: “Don’t leave anyone behind. Bring no-one alive.”</p> <p>In her judgement, Korner referred to a top-level secret Sudanese government plan to “restore security” and “impose control” on the rebellious non-Arab populations of Darfur, which was to be carried out by the Janjaweed with the help of air and other support from the Sudanese army.</p> <p>Korner said that the secret plan also called for the Janjaweed to “assassinate sympathisers from amongst community leaders and local administration officials”.&nbsp;</p> <p>The court found that it was this plan “which provided the blueprint for the commission of the crimes that then took place”. The Janjaweed, acting on government instructions, carried out armed operations against villages made up of Fur and other non-Arab Sudanese people.&nbsp;</p> <p>Korner described “Fur men of all ages” being detained, tortured and executed outside their towns by members of the Janjaweed together with government of Sudan forces.</p> <h3>Response from Darfur</h3> <p>Victims of the Darfur conflict said the milestone judgment had restored some faith in the ICC and its slow procedures, according to Reuters.</p> <p>“As victims, the ruling is a victory for us and for justice, because the crimes he committed had huge impacts for the last 22 years.
