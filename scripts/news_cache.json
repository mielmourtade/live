Congress was set to be briefed on the new regime this week.</p> <p>The MTCR is a non-binding agreement among 35 countries. It is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-international-security-and-nonproliferation/releases/2025/01/missile-technology-control-regime-mtcr-frequently-asked-questions&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiQx4rjnMKPAxXfRPEDHd5TH0YQFnoECC0QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw24ivW1XCYiwKjwG-89Rkf1\">not a treaty</a> and therefore, the administration has a broader scope to change how it interprets US obligations under it.</p> <p>In 2020, during his first term in office, Trump relaxed how the US classifies drones under MTCR. The current move, MEE understands, would expand on that. According to Reuters, the US will <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/trump-reinterpret-1987-missile-treaty-sell-heavy-attack-drones-abroad-2025-09-05/\">designate</a> drones as aircraft.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>The administration’s shift underscores how fast the battle-space and arms industry has been transformed by drones, which have been used in the recent <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-attacks-iran&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjd1uaRncKPAxWkbvEDHdW6NZAQFnoECBkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1yaBQGu9z6i2pgD8oOaQgi\">conflict</a> between Israel and Iran and wars in Ukraine, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and the Caucasus.</p> <p>The MTCR was established before drones were invented; however, under it, the US considered the MQ-9 a long-range missile due to its speed and ability to carry a large payload, which led to stricter export controls.</p> <p>MEE reported in May that the Trump administration was streamlining the process for foreign military sales. The efforts started before Trump visited the oil-rich Gulf, where he sealed pledges from Gulf states to purchase tens of billions of dollars' worth of arms, aircraft, and AI chips - commitments that have yet to translate into cash deals.</p> <p>Trump’s move could push up the timeline for Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE to purchase MQ-9 Reaper drones.</p> <h3>The Gulf and&nbsp;MQ-9 drones</h3> <p>After Trump’s visit to the Gulf, General Atomics, the maker of MQ-9 drones, said it was in talks with Saudi Arabia for an order of up to 200 drones.
