So loud it drowns out thought.

For a few seconds, you’re unable to comprehend what just happened.

They now happen in quick succession - two, sometimes three detonated together. Yesterday, there were three in a row. The noise was overwhelming.</p> <p>It’s not just frightening. It’s physically painful.</p> <p>Your head throbs for hours. Something feels wrong inside you.</p> <p>You feel your life is in immediate danger - as if the blast could tear your body apart.

And we have chosen to act.</p> <p>South Africa comes from a lived history of tyranny and oppression. It is the UN and many of its agencies which declared apartheid and white minority domination as \"a crime against humanity\", an \"affront to human dignity\" and \"a threat to international peace and security\".</p> <p>Our commitment to end impunity when genocide and crimes against humanity are being committed is, in part, born out of this abomination of apartheid and the scourges suffered by many of our people.</p> <p>But we also stand for certain values and principles, not in the least the commitment to uphold and defend international law and international humanitarian law.</p> <p>Our government has taken a principled stance, rooted in our stated and ensconced constitutional values and our obligations. We have done so not to provoke, but to protect. Not to isolate, but to illuminate.</p> <p>We have brought <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-icj-case\">our case</a> before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) not only to preserve life in Gaza, but to safeguard the integrity of international law itself.</p> <h3>Complicity not neutrality&nbsp;</h3> <p>We are anti-war and pro-peace in our international doctrines. Inaction in the face of atrocity is not neutrality, it is complicity. And complicity corrodes the very institutions meant to uphold our shared humanity.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-icj-south-africa-genocide-case-israel-explained\">The ICJ case </a>brought by South Africa is not an indictment of a people, but of a policy, a policy of destruction, displacement, disregard and impunity. The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, has <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/un-concludes-israel-guilty-genocide-gaza\">now corroborated</a> what we feared.</p> <blockquote> <p>If the ICJ’s rulings are ignored, if the UN’s findings are dismissed, if the world’s conscience is numbed then what becomes of accountability in other conflicts?</p> </blockquote> <p>The commission <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/un-concludes-israel-guilty-genocide-gaza\">stated</a> that Israel has flagrantly disregarded the ICJ’s provisional measures and persisted in a campaign of devastation against the Palestinian people.</p> <p>The commission found that Israeli authorities had no intention to change course. On the contrary, they have continued what can only be described as a \"genocidal campaign\"&nbsp;in Gaza for nearly two years.</p> <p>The destruction is not incidental, it is systematic. It includes the annihilation of homes, agricultural<br /> lands and infrastructure essential to Palestinian life. It is consistent, instructive statements of the Israeli leaders to destroy a people.</p> <p>This is not conjecture. It is documented. It is deliberate.</p> <p>We<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-icj-south-africa-genocide-case-israel-explained\"> submitted</a> to the ICJ a litany of statements that reflect this intent. Among them, the words of Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who declared in the wake of the heinous 7 October attacks: \"It's an entire nation out there that is responsible. It is not true, this rhetoric about civilians who were not aware and not involved. It is absolutely not true.\"</p> <p></p> <p>Or the chilling exhortation of Ezra Yachin, a 95-year-old Israeli army veteran, who <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-palestine-war-veteran-ezra-yachin-soldiers-erase-children\">told</a> Israeli army&nbsp;soldiers: \"Be triumphant and finish them off and don't leave anyone behind. Erase the memory of them. Erase them, their families, mothers, and children. These animals can no longer live.\"</p> <p>These are not isolated utterances. They are part of a pattern, a pattern that we argue&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/those-who-still-deny-gaza-genocide-are-complicit-israels-atrocities\">meets the threshold </a>of genocidal intent under<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MiddleEastEye/videos/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-says-top-legal-scholar-melanie-obrien/1020132060206877/\"> the Genocide Convention</a>.</p> <p>As per the independent commission's report, the question now is not whether genocide is occurring. The question is whether the world will allow it to continue.</p> <h3>Gaza: The litmus test</h3> <p>South Africa’s intervention is not limited to Gaza. We have committed ourselves to acting within the institutions of global governance to protect the right to life in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and anywhere conflict threatens human dignity.</p> <p>But Gaza is a litmus test.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/south-africa-palestine-trumps-war-defend-apartheid\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/south-africa-protest-palestine-israel-durban-may-2021-rajesh-jantilal-afp.jpg.webp?itok=zRRrZg58\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">From South Africa to Palestine: Trump's war to defend apartheid</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/south-africa-palestine-trumps-war-defend-apartheid\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>It is where the credibility of international law is on trial. If the ICJ’s rulings are ignored, if the UN’s findings are dismissed, if the world’s conscience is numbed, then what becomes of accountability in other conflicts? What becomes of the multilateral system itself?</p> <p>We are not naive. Our stance has come at a cost. In the corridors of power, we have been labelled anti-Israel, pro-Hamas. But these labels are distractions. They obscure the real issue: the equal application of international law.</p> <p>South Africa still believes in a two-state solution. We still believe in peace. But peace cannot be built on the rubble of impunity.</p> <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly, under the theme Better Together, must decide whether to vindicate Truman’s vision or betray it. Will it reaffirm the charter’s foundation stone of justice, or will it allow that stone to be buried beneath the weight of political expediency?</p> <p>The long overdue recognition of the State of Palestine by an increasing number of states could be a testament to this determination.</p> <p>South Africa has chosen to lead by example as we chose to co-chair <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/holding-israel-accountable-what-hague-group\">The Hague Group</a> to vindicate international law and, to this end, we are encouraged by the establishment of the Madrid Group, which aligns with the need to address impunity.</p> <p>We have acted not with words alone, but with concrete acts of goodwill. We have stood up not only for the Palestinians, but for the principle that no people anywhere should be erased. Impunity ends when the world helps the UN to fulfil its obligations.</p> <p>Let it be here.

We’ve been there. I’m not going to take over any more countries and try and teach them the colonial method. It never worked,’” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Barrack added that they would cooperate with countries in the region on issues such as counterterrorism, but “that’s it”. Apart from Israel, that is.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Israel [is] a different story. Israel is a valued ally. We subsidise them $4 or $5 billion a year. It has a special place in America’s heart. And we’re living with the confusion of what’s happening in this transition. So it’s complicated.”&nbsp;</p> <h3>‘Peace is an illusion’</h3> <p>When asked what the endgame was in the region for the US administration, he dismissed the idea of peace.</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/britains-recognition-palestine-overshadowed-israeli-genocide\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/2025-09-22T131556Z_537778868_MT1ZUMA000JABWCI_RTRMADP_3_ZUMA%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=NEDaG9Og\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Britain's recognition of Palestine is overshadowed by Israeli genocide</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/britains-recognition-palestine-overshadowed-israeli-genocide\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>“When we say peace, it’s an illusion. There’s never been peace. There will probably never be peace because everybody’s fighting for legitimacy,” Barrack said.&nbsp;</p> <p>“So people say, well, they’re fighting over borders and boundaries. It’s not what they're finding over. A border or a boundary is the currency of a negotiation.</p> <p>“The end result is somebody wants dominance, which means somebody has to submit. In that part of the world, submit, there’s no Arabic word for submit. They can’t wrap their head around submit. So eventually, prosperity is the only answer.”</p> <p>That particular quote was heavily criticised on social media, with many pointing out that the word “Islam”, among other words, can translate to submission.&nbsp;</p> <h3>‘Israel is attacking everybody’&nbsp;</h3> <p>In a section of the interview talking about the situation in Lebanon, Barrack was asked what the incentive was for <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/lebanon-inside-efforts-disarm-hezbollah\">Hezbollah to disarm</a>. He replied: “Zero”.</p> <p>“This is the problem, especially when Israel is attacking everybody. So Israel is attacking Syria. Israel is attacking Lebanon. Israel is attacking Tunisia,” he continued.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>He was referring to frequent Israeli strikes across Syria since Bashar al-Assad’s government fell in December, and the near-daily Israeli breaches of the ceasefire agreed in Lebanon in November.&nbsp;</p> <p>As for Tunisia, Barrack was likely referring to <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/flotilla-gaza-struck-drone-tunisian-port\">a suspected drone strike</a> on the Global Sumud Flotilla, which is currently heading towards Gaza. Israel has not taken responsibility for the attack.&nbsp;</p> <p>“As it goes on, [Hezbollah’s] argument gets better and better: ‘We’re here to protect the Lebanese from Israel’. Israel has five points [that it still occupies in Lebanon] and is not withdrawing,” Barrack added.</p> <h3>‘Arming Lebanon so they can fight their own people’&nbsp;</h3> <p>Elsewhere in the discussion about Lebanon, Barrack repeatedly said that it was on the Lebanese government to <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/lebanon-disarm-hezbollah\">disarm Hezbollah</a>.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/from-taif-to-today-history-attempts-disarm-hezbollah\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/lebanon-hezbollah-nasrallah-ashura-rally-10-july-1992-afp.jpg.webp?itok=8qzgXgtF\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">From Taif to today: A history of attempts to disarm Hezbollah</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/from-taif-to-today-history-attempts-disarm-hezbollah\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>“We’ll usher. We’ll give our advice. We’ll help, but they’ve got to solve it,” he said. “The Lebanese government, if they want to get back on track, has to say ‘We’re going to <a href=\"http://middleeasteye.net/news/from-taif-to-today-history-attempts-disarm-hezbollah\">disarm Hezbollah</a>’.”</p> <p>He described the Lebanese Armed Forces, which he shortened to LAF, as “well-meaning” but “not well-equipped”.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Because who are they going to fight? We don’t want to arm them… so they can fight Israel? I don’t think so,” the special envoy said.&nbsp;</p> <p>“So you’re arming them so they can fight their own people, Hezbollah. Hezbollah is our enemy. Iran is our enemy.</p> <p>“We need to cut the heads off of those snakes and chop the flow of funds. That’s the only way you’re going to stop Hezbollah.</p> <p>“You’re not going to have LAF go knock on the door of a Shia house… and say, 'Excuse me, ma’am, can I go and take the rockets and the AK-47s out of your basement? And if not, I’m going to take you away at gunpoint.’”</p> <h3>‘Jerusalem is going to take care of Hezbollah’</h3> <p>Barrack went on to say that America would not directly intervene on the issue of Hezbollah in Lebanon, but Israel would.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div> <div class=\"adsense responsive\"> <!-- responsive --> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins> </div> </div> </div> <p>“I would say the Lebanese, and I don’t mean this in a disrespectful way, all they do is talk,” he stated.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/unwilling-and-unable-half-gaza-city-refuses-flee-israeli-attacks-intensify\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/gaza%20city%20israel%20man%20hands%20air%20bomb%20reuters.jpg.webp?itok=Fr34OXZo\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">‘Unwilling and unable’: Half of Gaza City refuses to flee as Israeli attacks intensify</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/unwilling-and-unable-half-gaza-city-refuses-flee-israeli-attacks-intensify\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>“We told them, 'Do you want our help? We’ll give you our help.’ We gave them a playbook. They can’t get there.</p> <p>“So we say, 'Fine, we’re not going to execute. You know who’s going to execute? Walk across that border. Do you see where Jerusalem is? Jerusalem is going to take care of Hezbollah for you.”</p> <p>He went on to say that Hezbollah was rebuilding during the current ceasefire, and that it has “$60m a month coming from some place”.&nbsp;</p> <p>He also suggested that there was more incentive for a Hezbollah fighter than a Lebanese army soldier.&nbsp;</p> <p>“A Hezbollah troop makes an average of 1,000 to 2,000 [US dollars] a month. A Lebanese soldier makes 200 to 300 a month, so if you’re a Lebanese soldier, you have to be an Uber driver, a barista, and pick up garbage on the weekends in order to fight,” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Hezbollah also runs the best municipalities. They have water, they have power, they have waste management, because <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iran\">Iran</a> is funding that money. So if you want to get rid of Hezbollah, you choke Iran.”</p> <p>He once again reiterated that there would be no US boots on the ground.&nbsp;</p> <p>“We’re not going to go take Hezbollah out with our troops, with Centcom. Israel will just continue on. They bomb it daily because Hezbollah’s moving rockets, missiles, IRGs.”&nbsp;</p> <h3>‘Ceasefire not going to work’ in Gaza</h3> <p>Barrack said that the war in Gaza was “unsettling”.&nbsp;</p> <p>He said that whether deaths in Gaza were happening because Hamas was “taking two million people hostage” in the enclave - which he said he believed to be true - or whether it was “Israel being overly aggressive”, it did not matter and has “got to end”.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/how-israel-using-robots-exploding-vehicles-and-paratroopers-erase-gaza-city\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/gaza%20bombing%20tower%20minaret%20reuters.jpg.webp?itok=0YvtQcNX\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">How Israel is using robots, exploding vehicles and paratroopers to erase Gaza City</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/how-israel-using-robots-exploding-vehicles-and-paratroopers-erase-gaza-city\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>Asked whether the US is undermining that position by not supporting a ceasefire, he rejected the idea of a truce.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I think there’s been 27 ceasefires. None of them work. Ceasefire is not going to work.”</p> <p>It is not clear what the number 27 was referring to. There have been two short periods of a fragile halt in hostilities since Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/meaning-definition-what-genocide-israel-gaza\">genocide on Gaza</a> began in October 2023.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of those was in late November 2023 for around a week, and the other was between January and March 2025, before Israel unilaterally ended the truce.&nbsp;</p> <p>Barrack later added that the situation in Gaza was bad for “all sides”.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I hate what’s happening in Gaza on all sides. For the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestinians</a>, for the Israelis, for the Jordanians, for the Lebanese, for the Syrians, for the Turks,” he said. “It’s a mess.”&nbsp;</p> <p>He also questioned why other countries in the region \"won't take\" Palestinians.</p> <p>\"Why won't the Arabs take them? Why won't Egypt take them, why won't Saudi Arabia take them. Why won anybody take them, it's a real quandary,\" said.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Gamble responded that it was because Palestinians wanted to stay on their own land, Barrack said: \"This idea of everybody staying on their own land could go on forever.\"</p> <p>\"It's not about the land, it's about legitimacy. It's about relevance. You're taking away their identity and that's not a good way to negotiate with anybody.\"</p> <h3>Qatar hosted Hamas and Taliban ‘at our request’</h3> <p>Asked about the impact of <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/explosions-heard-qatari-capital-doha\">Israel’s strike on Qatar targeting Hamas officials</a>, Barrack said that “It was not good”.</p> <p>“Qatar has been a great and valued ally to us since day one,” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>He added that in the US, people have said of Qatar that “they house Hamas, they house the Taliban”, referring to the fact that at different times, senior officials from the Palestinian and Afghan movements have been based in Doha.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/super-sparta-netanyahus-megalomania-hits-fever-pitch-will-arab-states-act\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Israeli%20Prime%20Minister%20Benjamin%20Netanyahu%20holds%20a%20joint%20press%20conference%20on%2015%20%20September%2C%202025%20%28Reuters%29.jpg.webp?itok=HxtdRhix\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">'Super Sparta': Netanyahu's megalomania hits a fever pitch</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/super-sparta-netanyahus-megalomania-hits-fever-pitch-will-arab-states-act\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>“They did it at our request. If we didn’t have some conduit to be able to speak to them, we would never get there.”&nbsp;</p> <p>That position seems to contradict Karoline Leavitt, the White House’s press secretary, who <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/09/trump-israelis-doha-strike-white-house-leavitt\">following the attack</a> was critical of the location but suggested that “eliminating Hamas” in such a way was a “worthy goal”.&nbsp;</p> <p>Barrack was asked whether Israel overstepped by carrying out the attack in Doha without Washington’s permission.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I don’t agree with a lot of things that [Israel] do, but I respect them,” he said. “Because they tell you exactly what’s going to happen.”</p> <p>“If [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] feels that his borders or his people are being threatened, he will go anywhere and do anything, full stop.”</p> <p>Asked whether he feared that countries in the region would pivot towards China as a new security guarantor following the Doha strike, he was dismissive.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"I think we'll see them saying that and not doing that,\" Barrack said. \"One of our requirements in trade... is to distance yourself from China and Russia and come with us.</p> <h3>‘It’s not the United States of Israel’</h3> <p>The special envoy said that he didn’t trust any actor in the region.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I don’t trust any of them. Our interests are not aligned. Ally is a mistaken word,” he said. Barrack was then asked to clarify if that included Israel.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Absolutely. Our interests are vectors, right? There’s metrics,” he said.</p> <p>“There’s things that we’re aligned with and there’s things that we are not aligned with. So there’s no unanimity, it’s not the United States of Israel. It’s not the United States of the Gulf. It’s not the United States of Turkey.</p> <p>“We find alignment of the necessity of interests and we bond together. But blind trust on any of them? I don’t think anybody’s ever had it.”&nbsp;</p> <h3>‘By 2045, you’re going to have 5 billion Muslims’</h3> <p>In one section of the interview, he was asked about a Palestinian state, which Barrack was reminded that the majority of the global community supports.&nbsp;</p> <p>“The world’s not doing a very good job of implementing or convincing anybody,” he said. “When you say the world, nobody has any skin in the game, except Israel and us.”&nbsp;</p> <p>“We’re befriending, and we have befriended, Islam and the East. And by the way, you have to,” he added.&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-explainers mee-readmore-type-image align-right\"> <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/what-greater-israel\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-2024-afp.jpg.webp?itok=X6lOidyE\" width=\"400\" /> </a> <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">What is 'Greater Israel'?</div> <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/what-greater-israel\">Read More »</a> </div> <p>“If you just look at the demographics, you’re going to have, by 2040-2045, 10 billion people in the world. You're going to have five billion Muslims.. So are we going to keep pounding, from little Israel, against five billion Muslims?”</p> <p>There are around two billion Muslims in the world currently. It’s not clear what evidence Barrack was using to suggest that this would more than double in less than two decades.&nbsp;</p> <p>He was later asked, considering that Muslim populations are growing, if there would be blowback in the US for its funding of Israeli military actions in Gaza.</p> <p>“I think America is divided on that issue,” he said. “Either there’ll be a solution that people say was worth it, or there’ll be a solution that wasn’t worth it. And people can vote with their feet the next time around.”&nbsp;</p> <h3>‘Wouldn’t rule out’ future Iran attack</h3> <p>To conclude the interview, Barrack was asked if the US felt the need for another “definitive strike” on Iran, following the days-long conflict between Israel and Iran in June.&nbsp;</p> <p>He began by saying that Iranian people were “sensational”.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Educated, thoughtful, civilised. I don’t want to see them harmed in any way,” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>“What Israel would do is another question, but it seems as though they’re marching towards a resolution of the entire problem, which is what Gaza is, right?</p> <p>“I would imagine that just getting Gaza under control, and Hezbollah under control and the Houthis under control is not fruitful if you don’t get the Iran regime under control.</p> <p>“I have no information as to what they’re going to do, but I wouldn’t rule that out.”</p> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\"> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div> <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\"> <div>Post Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\"> <div>Update Date</div> <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time> </div> </div> <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\"> <div>Update Date Override</div> <div>0</div> </div> </div> </article>",
